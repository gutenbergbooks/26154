<h2>I</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE ADVENTURE OF THE FAIR PATRONNE</strong></p>


<p>In narrating these few episodes in the undulatory,
not to say switchback, career of my
friend Aristide Pujol, I can pretend to no
chronological sequence. Some occurred before he
(almost literally) crossed my path for the first
time, some afterwards. They have been related to
me haphazard at odd times, together with a hundred
other incidents, just as a chance tag of association
recalled them to his swift and picturesque
memory. He would, indeed, make a show of fixing
dates by reference to his temporary profession; but
so Protean seem to have been his changes of fortune
in their number and rapidity that I could never
keep count of them or their order. Nor does it
matter. The man&#8217;s life was as disconnected as a
pack of cards.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
My first meeting with him happened in this wise.</p>

<p>I had been motoring in a listless, solitary fashion
about Languedoc. A friend who had stolen a few
days from anxious business in order to accompany
me from Boulogne through Touraine and Guienne
had left me at Toulouse; another friend whom I
had arranged to pick up at Avignon on his way
from Monte Carlo was unexpectedly delayed. I
was therefore condemned to a period of solitude
somewhat irksome to a man of a gregarious temperament.
At first, for company&#8217;s sake, I sat in
front by my chauffeur, McKeogh. But McKeogh,
an atheistical Scotch mechanic with his soul in his
cylinders, being as communicative as his own differential,
I soon relapsed into the equal loneliness
and greater comfort of the back.</p>

<p>In this fashion I left Montpellier one morning on
my leisurely eastward journey, deciding to break
off from the main road, striking due south, and visit
Aigues-Mortes on the way.</p>

<p>Aigues-Mortes was once a flourishing Mediterranean
town. St. Louis and his Crusaders sailed
thence twice for Palestine; Charles V. and Francis
I. met there and filled the place with glittering
state. But now its glory has departed. The sea
has receded three or four miles, and left it high
and dry in the middle of bleak salt marshes, useless,
dead and desolate, swept by the howling mistral
and scorched by the blazing sun. The straight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
white ribbon of road which stretched for miles
through the plain, between dreary vineyards&mdash;some
under water, the black shoots of the vines appearing
like symmetrical wreckage above the surface&mdash;was
at last swallowed up by the grim central
gateway of the town, surmounted by its frowning
tower. On each side spread the brown machicolated
battlements that vainly defended the death-stricken
place. A soft northern atmosphere would
have invested it in a certain mystery of romance,
but in the clear southern air, the towers and walls
standing sharply defined against the blue, wind-swept
sky, it looked naked and pitiful, like a poor
ghost caught in the daylight.</p>

<p>At some distance from the gate appeared the
usual notice as to speed-limit. McKeogh, most
scrupulous of drivers, obeyed. As there was a knot
of idlers underneath and beyond the gate he slowed
down to a crawl, sounding a patient and monotonous
horn. We advanced; the peasant folk cleared
the way sullenly and suspiciously. Then, deliberately,
an elderly man started to cross the road,
and on the sound of the horn stood stock still, with
resentful defiance on his weather-beaten face. McKeogh
jammed on the brakes. The car halted.
But the infinitesimal fraction of a second before it
came to a dead stop the wing over the near front
wheel touched the elderly person and down he went
on the ground. I leaped from the car, to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
instantly surrounded by an infuriated crowd, which
seemed to gather from all the quarters of the broad,
decaying square. The elderly man, helped to his
feet by sympathetic hands, shook his knotted fists
in my face. He was a dour and ugly peasant, of
splendid physique, as hard and discoloured as the
walls of Aigues-Mortes; his cunning eyes were as
clear as a boy&#8217;s, his lined, clean-shaven face as
rigid as a gargoyle; and the back of his neck, above
the low collar of his jersey, showed itself seamed
into glazed irregular lozenges, like the hide of a
crocodile. He cursed me and my kind healthily in
very bad French and apostrophized his friends in
Proven&ccedil;al, who in Proven&ccedil;al and bad French made
responsive clamour. I had knocked him down on
purpose. He was crippled for life. Who was
I to go tearing through peaceful towns with my
execrated locomotive and massacring innocent people?
I tried to explain that the fault was his, and
that, after all, to judge by the strength of his
lungs, no great damage had been inflicted. But no.
They would not let it go like that. There were the
gendarmes&mdash;I looked across the square and saw
two gendarmes striding portentously towards the
scene&mdash;they would see justice done. The law was
there to protect poor folk. For a certainty I would
not get off easily.</p>

<img src="images/img014.jpg" width="600" height="454" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">i had knocked him down on purpose. he was crippled for life</span>
</div>

<p>I knew what would happen. The gendarmes
would submit McKeogh and myself to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<em>proc&egrave;s-verbal</em>. They would impound the car. I should
have to go to the Mairie and make endless depositions.
I should have to wait, Heaven knows how
long, before I could appear before the <em>juge de paix</em>.
I should have to find a solicitor to represent me.
In the end I should be fined for furious driving&mdash;at
the rate, when the accident happened, of a mile
an hour&mdash;and probably have to pay a heavy compensation
to the wilful and uninjured victim of
McKeogh&#8217;s impeccable driving. And all the time,
while waiting for injustice to take its course,
I should be the guest of a hostile population. I
grew angry. The crowd grew angrier. The gendarmes
approached with an air of majesty and
fate. But just before they could be acquainted with
the brutal facts of the disaster a singularly bright-eyed
man, wearing a hard felt hat and a blue serge
suit, flashed like a meteor into the midst of the
throng, glanced with an amazing swiftness at me,
the car, the crowd, the gendarmes and the victim,
ran his hands up and down the person of the last
mentioned, and then, with a frenzied action of a
figure in a bad cinematograph rather than that of a
human being, subjected the inhabitants to an infuriated
philippic in Proven&ccedil;al, of which I could
not understand one word. The crowd, with here
and there a murmur of remonstrance, listened to
him in silence. When he had finished they hung
their heads, the gendarmes shrugged their majestic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and fateful shoulders and lit cigarettes, and the
gargoyle-visaged ancient with the neck of crocodile
hide turned grumbling away. I have never witnessed
anything so magical as the effect produced
by this electric personage. Even McKeogh, who
during the previous clamour had sat stiff behind his
wheel, keeping expressionless eyes fixed on the cap
of the radiator, turned his head two degrees of a
circle and glanced at his surroundings.</p>

<p>The instant peace was established our rescuer
darted up to me with the directness of a dragon-fly
and shook me warmly by the hand. As he had
done me a service, I responded with a grateful
smile; besides, his aspect was peculiarly prepossessing.
I guessed him to be about five-and-thirty. He
had a clear olive complexion, black moustache and
short silky vandyke beard, and the most fascinating,
the most humorous, the most mocking, the
most astonishingly bright eyes I have ever seen in
my life. I murmured a few expressions of thanks,
while he prolonged the handshake with the fervour
of a long-lost friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s all right, my dear sir. Don&#8217;t worry any
more,&rdquo; he said in excellent English, but with a
French accent curiously tinged with Cockney. &ldquo;The
old gentleman&#8217;s as sound as a bell&mdash;not a bruise on
his body.&rdquo; He pushed me gently to the step of the
car. &ldquo;Get in and let me guide you to the only
place where you can eat in this accursed town.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Before I could recover from my surprise, he was
by my side in the car shouting directions to
McKeogh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! These people!&rdquo; he cried, shaking his hands
with outspread fingers in front of him. &ldquo;They have
no manners, no decency, no self-respect. It&#8217;s a regular
trade. They go and get knocked down by
automobiles on purpose, so that they can claim indemnity.
They breed dogs especially and train
them to commit suicide under the wheels so that
they can get compensation. There&#8217;s one now&mdash;<em>ah,
sacr&eacute;e b&ecirc;te!</em>&rdquo; He leaned over the side of the car
and exchanged violent objurgation with the dog.
&ldquo;But never mind. So long as I am here you can
run over anything you like with impunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m very much obliged to you,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You&#8217;ve
saved me from a deal of foolish unpleasantness.
From the way you handled the old gentleman I
should guess you to be a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s one of the few things I&#8217;ve never been,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;No; I&#8217;m not a doctor. One of these
days I&#8217;ll tell you all about myself.&rdquo; He spoke as
if our sudden acquaintance would ripen into life-long
friendship. &ldquo;There&#8217;s the hotel&mdash;the H&ocirc;tel
Saint-Louis,&rdquo; he pointed to the sign a little way up
the narrow, old-world, cobble-paved street we were
entering. &ldquo;Leave it to me; I&#8217;ll see that they treat
you properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The car drew up at the doorway. My electric
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
friend leaped out and met the emerging landlady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Bonjour, madame.</em> I&#8217;ve brought you one of my
very good friends, an English gentleman of the
most high importance. He will have <em>d&eacute;jeuner&mdash;tout
ce qu&#8217;il y a de mieux</em>. None of your cabbage-soup
and eels and <em>andouilles</em>, but a good omelette,
some fresh fish, and a bit of very tender meat. Will
that suit you?&rdquo; he asked, turning to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellently,&rdquo; said I, smiling. &ldquo;And since
you&#8217;ve ordered me so charming a <em>d&eacute;jeuner</em>, perhaps
you&#8217;ll do me the honour of helping me to eat it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the very greatest pleasure,&rdquo; said he, without
a second&#8217;s hesitation.</p>

<p>We entered the small, stuffy dining-room, where
a dingy waiter, with a dingier smile, showed us to
a small table by the window. At the long table in
the middle of the room sat the half-dozen frequenters
of the house, their napkins tucked under
their chins, eating in gloomy silence a dreary meal
of the kind my new friend had deprecated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we drink?&rdquo; I asked, regarding with
some disfavour the thin red and white wines in the
decanters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but this <em>piquette du pays</em>.
It tastes like a mixture of sea-water and vinegar.
It produces the look of patient suffering that you
see on those gentlemen&#8217;s faces. You, who are not
used to it, had better not venture. It would excoriate
your throat. It would dislocate your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
pancreas. It would play the very devil with you.
Adolphe&rdquo;&mdash;he beckoned the waiter&mdash;&ldquo;there&#8217;s a little
white wine of the C&ocirc;tes du Rhone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
glanced at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m in your hands,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>As far as eating and drinking went I could not
have been in better. Nor could anyone desire a
more entertaining chance companion of travel.
That he had thrust himself upon me in the most
brazen manner and taken complete possession of
me there could be no doubt. But it had all been
done in the most irresistibly charming manner in the
world. One entirely forgot the impudence of the
fellow. I have since discovered that he did not lay
himself out to be agreeable. The flow of talk and
anecdote, the bright laughter that lit up a little
joke, making it appear a very brilliant joke indeed,
were all spontaneous. He was a man, too, of some
cultivation. He knew France thoroughly, England
pretty well; he had a discriminating taste in architecture,
and waxed poetical over the beauties of
Nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It strikes me as odd,&rdquo; said I at last, somewhat
ironically, &ldquo;that so vital a person as yourself should
find scope for your energies in this dead-and-alive
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw up his hands. &ldquo;I live here? I crumble
and decay in Aigues-Mortes? For whom do you
take me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
I replied that, not having the pleasure of knowing
his name and quality, I could only take him for an
enigma.</p>

<p>He selected a card from his letter-case and
handed it to me across the table. It bore the
legend:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
              <span class="smcap">Aristide Pujol</span>,<br />
                      Agent.<br />
          213 bis, Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;, Paris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That address will always find me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Civility bade me give him my card, which he put
carefully in his letter-case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owe my success in life,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to the fact
that I have never lost an opportunity or a visiting-card.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn your perfect English?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;among English tourists at
Marseilles. Then in England. I was Professor of
French at an academy for young ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you were a success?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>He regarded me drolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and no,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>The meal over, we left the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you would like to visit the
towers on the ramparts. I would dearly love to
accompany you, but I have business in the town.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
I will take you, however, to the <em>gardien</em> and put
you in his charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raced me to the gate by which I had entered.
The <em>gardien des remparts</em> issued from his lodge at
Aristide Pujol&#8217;s summons and listened respectfully
to his exhortation in Proven&ccedil;al. Then he went for
his keys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll not say good-bye,&rdquo; Aristide Pujol declared,
amiably. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll get through my business long before
you&#8217;ve done your sight-seeing, and you&#8217;ll find
me waiting for you near the hotel. <em>Au revoir, cher
ami.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled, lifted his hat, waved his hand in a
friendly way, and darted off across the square. The
old <em>gardien</em> came out with the keys and took me
off to the Tour de Constance, where Protestants
were imprisoned pell-mell after the revocation of
the Edict of Nantes; thence to the Tour des Bourguignons,
where I forget how many hundred Burgundians
were massacred and pickled in salt; and,
after these cheery exhibitions, invited me to walk
round the ramparts and inspect the remaining
eighteen towers of the enceinte. As the mistral,
however, had sprung up and was shuddering across
the high walls, I declined, and, having paid him his
fee, descended to the comparative shelter of the
earth.</p>

<p>There I found Aristide Pujol awaiting me at the
corner of the narrow street in which the hotel was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
situated. He was wearing&mdash;like most of the young
bloods of Provence in winter-time&mdash;a short, shaggy,
yet natty goat-skin coat, ornamented with enormous
bone buttons, and a little cane valise stood near by
on the kerb of the square.</p>

<p>He was not alone. Walking arm in arm with
him was a stout, elderly woman of swarthy complexion
and forbidding aspect. She was attired in
a peasant&#8217;s or small shopkeeper&#8217;s rusty Sunday
black and an old-fashioned black bonnet prodigiously
adorned with black plumes and black roses.
Beneath this bonnet her hair was tightly drawn up
from her forehead; heavy eyebrows overhung a
pair of small, crafty eyes, and a tuft of hair grew
on the corner of a prognathous jaw. She might
have been about seven-and-forty.</p>

<p>Aristide Pujol, unlinking himself from this unattractive
female, advanced and saluted me with
considerable deference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>As I am neither a duke nor an archbishop, but
a humble member of the lower automobiling classes,
the high-flown title startled me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monseigneur, will you permit me,&rdquo; said he, in
French, &ldquo;to present to you Mme. Gougasse? Madame
is the <em>patronne</em> of the Caf&eacute; de l&#8217;Univers, at
Carcassonne, which doubtless you have frequented,
and she is going to do me the honour of marrying
me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">anything less congruous as the bride-elect of the
debonair aristide pujol it was impossible to imagine</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
The unexpectedness of the announcement took
my breath away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said I, in a whisper.</p>

<p>Anyone less congruous as the bride-elect of the
debonair Aristide Pujol it was impossible to imagine.
However, it was none of my business. I
raised my hat politely to the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame, I offer you my sincere felicitations.
As an entertaining husband I am sure you will find
M. Aristide Pujol without a rival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Je vous remercie, monseigneur</em>,&rdquo; she replied, in
what was obviously her best company manner.
&ldquo;And if ever you will deign to come again to the
Caf&eacute; de l&#8217;Univers at Carcassonne we will esteem
it a great honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you&#8217;re going to get married to-morrow?&rdquo;
I remarked, by way of saying something.
To congratulate Aristide Pujol on his choice lay
beyond my power of hypocrisy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my dear Am&eacute;lie will
make me the happiest of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We start for Carcassonne by the three-thirty
train,&rdquo; said Mme. Gougasse, pulling a great silver
watch from some fold of her person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is time,&rdquo; said I, pointing to a little
weather-beaten caf&eacute; in the square, &ldquo;to drink a glass
to your happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Bien volontiers</em>,&rdquo; said the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Pardon, ch&egrave;re amie</em>,&rdquo; Aristide interposed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
quickly. &ldquo;Unless monseigneur and I start at once
for Montpellier, I shall not have time to transact
my little affairs before your train arrives
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Parenthetically, I must remark that all trains
going from Aigues-Mortes to Carcassonne must
stop at Montpellier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s true,&rdquo; she agreed, in a hesitating manner.
&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, idol of my heart, though I am overcome
with grief at the idea of leaving you for two little
hours, it is a question of four thousand francs.
Four thousand francs are not picked up every day
in the street. It&#8217;s a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mme. Gougasse&#8217;s little eyes glittered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Bien s&ucirc;r.</em> And it&#8217;s quite settled?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it will be all for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promised all to me for the redecoration
of the ceiling of the caf&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three thousand will be sufficient, dear angel.
What? I know these contractors and decorators.
The more you pay them, the more abominable will
they make the ceiling. Leave it to me. I, Aristide,
will guarantee you a ceiling like that of the
Sistine Chapel for two thousand francs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled and bridled, so as to appear perfectly
well-bred in my presence. The act of smiling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
caused the tuft of hair on her jaw to twitch horribly.
A cold shiver ran down my back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you think, monseigneur,&rdquo; she asked,
archly, &ldquo;that M. Pujol should give me the four
thousand francs as a wedding-present?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; said I, in my heartiest voice,
entirely mystified by the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I yield,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;Ah, women,
women! They hold up their little rosy finger, and
the bravest of men has to lie down with his chin
on his paws like a good old watch-dog. You agree,
then, monseigneur, to my giving the whole of the
four thousand francs to Am&eacute;lie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; said I, convinced that the
swarthy lady of the prognathous jaw was bound to
have her own way in the end where money was
concerned, and yet for the life of me not seeing
how I had anything to do with the disposal of
Aristide Pujol&#8217;s property&mdash;&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;I command you to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>C&#8217;est bien gentil de votre part</em>,&rdquo; said madame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now the caf&eacute;,&rdquo; I suggested, with chattering
teeth. We had been standing all the time at
the corner of the square, while the mistral whistled
down the narrow street. The dust was driven
stingingly into our faces, and the women of the
place who passed us by held their black scarves
over their mouths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, monseigneur,&rdquo; said Mme. Gougasse,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
&ldquo;Aristide is right. You must start now for Montpellier
in the automobile. I will go by the train
for Carcassonne at three-thirty. It is the only train
from Aigues-Mortes. Aristide transacts his business
and joins me in the train at Montpellier. You
have not much time to spare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was bewildered. I turned to Aristide Pujol,
who stood, hands on hips, regarding his prospective
bride and myself with humorous benevolence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said I in English, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve not
the remotest idea of what the two of you are talking
about; but I gather you have arranged that I
should motor you to Montpellier. Now, I&#8217;m not
going to Montpellier. I&#8217;ve just come from there,
as I told you at <em>d&eacute;jeuner</em>. I&#8217;m going in the opposite
direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took me familiarly by the arm, and, with a
&ldquo;<em>Pardon, ch&egrave;re amie</em>,&rdquo; to the lady, led me a few
paces aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beseech you,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;it&#8217;s a matter of
four thousand francs, a hundred and sixty pounds,
eight hundred dollars, a new ceiling for the Caf&eacute;
de l&#8217;Univers, the dream of a woman&#8217;s life, and the
happiest omen for my wedded felicity. The fair
goddess Hymen invites you with uplifted torch.
You can&#8217;t refuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hypnotized me with his bright eyes, overpowered
my will by his winning personality. He
seemed to force me to desire his companionship. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
weakened. After all, I reflected, I was at a loose
end, and where I went did not matter to anybody.
Aristide Pujol had also done me a considerable
service, for which I felt grateful. I yielded with
good grace.</p>

<p>He darted back to Mme. Gougasse, alive with
gaiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ch&egrave;re amie</em>, if you were to press monseigneur,
I&#8217;m sure he would come to Carcassonne and dance
at our wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! That,&rdquo; said I, hastily, &ldquo;is out of the question.
But,&rdquo; I added, amused by a humorous idea,
&ldquo;why should two lovers separate even for a few
hours? Why should not madame accompany us to
Montpellier? There is room in my auto for three,
and it would give me the opportunity of making
madame&#8217;s better acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Am&eacute;lie!&rdquo; cried Aristide. &ldquo;What do you
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, it is too much honour,&rdquo; murmured Mme.
Gougasse, evidently tempted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s your luggage, however,&rdquo; said Aristide.
&ldquo;You would bring that great trunk, for which there
is no place in the automobile of monseigneur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s true&mdash;my luggage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send it on by train, <em>ch&egrave;re amie</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will it arrive at Carcassonne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-morrow,&rdquo; said Pujol, &ldquo;but perhaps next
week or the week after. Perhaps it may never come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
at all. One is never certain with these railway companies.
But what does that matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; cried the lady, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may arrive or it may not arrive; but you
are rich enough, <em>ch&egrave;re amie</em>, not to think of a few
camisoles and bits of jewellery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my lace and my silk dress that I have
brought to show your parents. <em>Merci!</em>&rdquo; she retorted,
with a dangerous spark in her little eyes.
&ldquo;You think one is made of money, eh? You will
soon find yourself mistaken, my friend. I would
give you to understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;. She checked herself
suddenly. &ldquo;Monseigneur&rdquo;&mdash;she turned to me with
a resumption of the gracious manner of her bottle-decked
counter at the Caf&eacute; de l&#8217;Univers&mdash;&ldquo;you are
too amiable. I appreciate your offer infinitely; but I
am not going to entrust my luggage to the kind
care of the railway company. <em>Merci, non.</em> They
are robbers and thieves. Even if it did arrive,
half the things would be stolen. Oh, I
know them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook the head of an experienced and self-reliant
woman. No doubt, distrustful of banks as
of railway companies, she kept her money hidden
in her bedroom. I pitied my poor young friend;
he would need all his gaiety to enliven the domestic
side of the Caf&eacute; de l&#8217;Univers.</p>

<p>The lady having declined my invitation, I expressed
my regrets; and Aristide, more emotional,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
voiced his sense of heart-rent desolation, and in a
resigned tone informed me that it was time to start.
I left the lovers and went to the hotel, where I
paid the bill, summoned McKeogh, and lit a companionable
pipe.</p>

<p>The car backed down the narrow street into the
square and took up its position. We entered. McKeogh
took charge of Aristide&#8217;s valise, tucked us
up in the rug, and settled himself in his seat. The
car started and we drove off, Aristide gallantly
brandishing his hat and Mme. Gougasse waving her
lily hand, which happened to be hidden in an ill-fitting
black glove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Montpellier, as fast as you can!&rdquo; he shouted
at the top of his lungs to McKeogh. Then he
sighed as he threw himself luxuriously back. &ldquo;Ah,
this is better than a train. Am&eacute;lie doesn&#8217;t know
what a mistake she has made!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The elderly victim of my furious entry was
lounging, in spite of the mistral, by the grim machicolated
gateway. Instead of scowling at me he
raised his hat respectfully as we passed. I touched
my cap, but Aristide returned the salute with the
grave politeness of royalty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a place,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which I would like
never to behold again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments we were whirling along the
straight, white road between the interminable black
vineyards, and past the dilapidated homesteads of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the vine-folk and wayside caf&eacute;s that are scattered
about this unjoyous corner of France.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, suddenly, &ldquo;what do you think
of my <em>fianc&eacute;e</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Politeness and good taste forbade expression of
my real opinion. I murmured platitudes to the
effect that she seemed to be a most sensible woman,
with a head for business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&#8217;s not what we in French call <em>jolie, jolie</em>;
but what of that? What&#8217;s the good of marrying
a pretty face for other men to make love to? And,
as you English say, there&#8217;s none of your confounded
sentiment about her. But she has the
most flourishing caf&eacute; in Carcassonne; and, when
the ceiling is newly decorated, provided she doesn&#8217;t
insist on too much gold leaf and too many naked
babies on clouds&mdash;it&#8217;s astonishing how women love
naked babies on clouds&mdash;it will be the snuggest place
in the world. May I ask for one of your excellent
cigarettes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I handed him the case from the pocket of the
car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was there that I made her acquaintance,&rdquo; he
resumed, after having lit the cigarette from my
pipe. &ldquo;We met, we talked, we fixed it up. She is
not the woman to go by four roads to a thing. She
did me the honour of going straight for me. Ah,
but what a wonderful woman! She rules that caf&eacute;
like a kingdom; a Semiramis, a Queen Elizabeth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
a Catherine de&#8217; Medici. She sits enthroned behind
the counter all day long and takes the money and
counts the saucers and smiles on rich clients, and
if a waiter in a far corner gives a bit of sugar to a
dog she spots it, and the waiter has a deuce of a
time. That woman is worth her weight in thousand-franc
notes. She goes to bed every night at
one, and gets up in the morning at five. And
virtuous! Didn&#8217;t Solomon say that a virtuous
woman was more precious than rubies? That&#8217;s the
kind of wife the wise man chooses when he gives
up the giddy ways of youth. Ah, my dear sir,
over and over again these last two or three days
my dear old parents&mdash;I have been on a visit to them
in Aigues-Mortes&mdash;have commended my wisdom.
Am&eacute;lie, who is devoted to me, left her caf&eacute; in Carcassonne
to make their acquaintance and receive
their blessing before our marriage, also to show
them the lace on her <em>dessous</em> and her new silk
dress. They are too old to take the long journey
to Carcassonne. &lsquo;My son,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;you are
making a marriage after our own hearts. We are
proud of you. Now we can die perfectly content.&rsquo;
I was wrong, perhaps, in saying that Am&eacute;lie has
no sentiment,&rdquo; he continued, after a short pause.
&ldquo;She adores me. It is evident. She will not allow
me out of her sight. Ah, my dear friend, you don&#8217;t
know what a happy man I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a brilliant young man of five-and-thirty, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
was about to marry a horrible Meg&aelig;ra ten or twelve
years his senior, he looked unhealthily happy.
There was no doubt that his handsome roguery had
caught the woman&#8217;s fancy. She was at the dangerous
age, when even the most ferro-concrete-natured
of women are apt to run riot. She was
comprehensible, and pardonable. But the man baffled
me. He was obviously marrying her for her
money; but how in the name of Diogenes and all
the cynics could he manage to look so confoundedly
joyful about it?</p>

<p>The mistral blew bitterly. I snuggled beneath
the rug and hunched up my shoulders so as to get
my ears protected by my coat-collar. Aristide, sufficiently
protected by his goat&#8217;s hide, talked like a
shepherd on a May morning. Why he took for
granted my interest in his unromantic, not to say
sordid, courtship I knew not; but he gave me the
whole history of it from its modest beginnings to
its now penultimate stage. From what I could make
out&mdash;for the mistral whirled many of his words
away over unheeding Provence&mdash;he had entered the
Caf&eacute; de l&#8217;Univers one evening, a human derelict
battered by buffeting waves of Fortune, and, finding
a seat immediately beneath Mme. Gougasse&#8217;s
<em>comptoir</em>, had straightway poured his grievances
into a feminine ear and, figuratively speaking,
rested his weary heart upon a feminine bosom.
And his buffetings and grievances and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
wearinesses? Whence came they? I asked the question
point-blank.</p>

<a name="img36" id="img36"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 429px;">
<img src="images/img036.jpg" width="429" height="500" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">had straightway poured his grievances into a feminine ear</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear friend,&rdquo; he answered, kissing his
gloved finger-tips, &ldquo;she was adorable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; I asked, taken aback. &ldquo;Mme. Gougasse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu</em>, no!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Not Mme. Gougasse.
Am&eacute;lie is solid, she is virtuous, she is
jealous, she is capacious; but I should not call her
adorable. No; the adorable one was twenty&mdash;delicious
and English; a peach-blossom, a zephyr, a
summer night&#8217;s dream, and the most provoking
little witch you ever saw in your life. Her father
and herself and six of her compatriots were touring
through France. They had circular tickets.
So had I. In fact, I was a miniature Thomas Cook
and Son to the party. I provided them with the
discomforts of travel and supplied erroneous information.
<em>Que voulez-vous?</em> If people ask you
for the history of a pair of Louis XV. corsets, in
a museum glass case, it&#8217;s much better to stimulate
their imagination by saying that they were worn
by Joan of Arc at the Battle of Agincourt than to
dull their minds by your ignorance. <em>Eh bien</em>, we go
through the ch&acirc;teaux of the Loire, through Poitiers
and Angoul&ecirc;me, and we come to Carcassonne.
You know Carcassonne? The great grim <em>cit&eacute;</em>, with
its battlements and bastions and barbicans and fifty
towers on the hill looking over the rubbishy modern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
town? We were there. The rest of the party were
buying picture postcards of the <em>gardien</em> at the foot
of the Tour de l&#8217;Inquisition. The man who invented
picture postcards ought to have his statue
on the top of the Eiffel Tower. The millions of
headaches he has saved! People go to places now
not to exhaust themselves by seeing them, but to
buy picture postcards of them. The rest of the
party, as I said, were deep in picture postcards.
Mademoiselle and I promenaded outside. We often
promenaded outside when the others were buying
picture postcards,&rdquo; he remarked, with an extra
twinkle in his bright eyes. &ldquo;And the result? Was
it my fault? We leaned over the parapet. The
wind blew a confounded <em>m&egrave;che</em>&mdash;what do you call
it&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;strand of her hair across her face. She
let it blow and laughed and did not move. Didn&#8217;t
I say she was a little witch? If there&#8217;s a Proven&ccedil;al
ever born who would not have kissed a girl under
such provocation I should like to have his mummy.
I kissed her. She kept on laughing. I kissed her
again. I kissed her four times. At the beginning
of the fourth kiss out came her father from the
postcard shop. He waited till the end of it and then
announced himself. He announced himself in such
ungentlemanly terms that I was forced to let the
whole party, including the adorable little witch, go
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
on to Pau by themselves, while I betook my broken
heart to the Caf&eacute; de l&#8217;Univers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there you found consolation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told my sad tale. Am&eacute;lie listened and called
the manager to take charge of the <em>comptoir</em>, and
poured herself out a glass of Frontignan. Am&eacute;lie
always drinks Frontignan when her heart is touched.
I came the next day and the next. It was pouring
with rain day and night&mdash;and Carcassonne in rain
is like Hades with its furnaces put out by human
tears&mdash;and the Caf&eacute; de l&#8217;Univers like a little warm
corner of Paradise stuck in the midst of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so that&#8217;s how it happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s how it happened. <em>Ma foi!</em> When a lady
asks a <em>galant homme</em> to marry her, what is he to
do? Besides, did I not say that the Caf&eacute; de l&#8217;Univers
was the most prosperous one in Carcassonne? I&#8217;m
afraid you English, my dear friend, have such sentimental
ideas about marriage. Now, we in France&mdash;&mdash; <em>Attendez,
attendez!</em>&rdquo; He suddenly broke off
his story, lurched forward, and gripped the back
of the front seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the right, man, to the right!&rdquo; he cried excitedly
to McKeogh.</p>

<p>We had reached the point where the straight road
from Aigues-Mortes branches into a fork, one road
going to Montpellier, the other to N&icirc;mes. Montpellier
being to the west, McKeogh had naturally
taken the left fork.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
&ldquo;To the right!&rdquo; shouted Aristide.</p>

<p>McKeogh pulled up and turned his head with a
look of protesting inquiry. I intervened with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re wrong in your geography, M. Pujol.
Besides, there is the signpost staring you in the
face. This is the way to Montpellier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, heaven-sent friend, I no more
want to go to Montpellier than you do!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Montpellier is the last place on earth I desire to
visit. You want to go to N&icirc;mes, and so do I. To
the right, chauffeur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do, sir?&rdquo; asked McKeogh.</p>

<p>I was utterly bewildered. I turned to the goat-skin-clad,
pointed-bearded, bright-eyed Aristide,
who, sitting bolt upright in the car, with his hands
stretched out, looked like a parody of the god Pan
in a hard felt hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t want to go to Montpellier?&rdquo; I asked,
stupidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;ten thousand times no; not for a king&#8217;s
ransom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your four thousand francs&mdash;your meeting
Mme. Gougasse&#8217;s train&mdash;your getting on to Carcassonne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could put twenty million continents between
myself and Carcassonne I&#8217;d do it,&rdquo; he explained,
with frantic gestures. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t you understand?
The good Lord who is always on my side
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
sent you especially to deliver me out of the hands
of that unspeakable Xantippe. There are no four
thousand francs. I&#8217;m not going to meet her train
at Montpellier, and if she marries anyone to-morrow
at Carcassonne it will not be Aristide Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ll go to N&icirc;mes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said McKeogh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said I, as soon as we had started
on the right-hand road, &ldquo;will you have the kindness
to explain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s nothing to explain,&rdquo; he cried, gleefully.
&ldquo;Here am I delivered. I am free. I can breathe
God&#8217;s good air again. I&#8217;m not going to marry
Yum-Yum, Yum-Yum. I feel ten years younger.
Oh, I&#8217;ve had a narrow escape. But that&#8217;s the way
with me. I always fall on my feet. Didn&#8217;t I tell
you I&#8217;ve never lost an opportunity? The moment I
saw an Englishman in difficulties, I realized my opportunity
of being delivered out of the House of
Bondage. I took it, and here I am! For two days
I had been racking my brains for a means of getting
out of Aigues-Mortes, when suddenly you&mdash;a
<em>Deus ex machina</em>&mdash;a veritable god out of the machine&mdash;come
to my aid. Don&#8217;t say there isn&#8217;t a
Providence watching over me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suggested that his mode of escape seemed somewhat
elaborate and fantastic. Why couldn&#8217;t he
have slipped quietly round to the railway station
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and taken a ticket to any haven of refuge he might
have fancied?</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the simple reason,&rdquo; said he, with a gay
laugh, &ldquo;that I haven&#8217;t a single penny piece in the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked so prosperous and untroubled that I
stared incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not one tiny bronze sou,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to take it pretty philosophically,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Les gueux, les gueux, sont des gens heureux</em>,&rdquo;
he quoted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re the first person who has made me believe
in the happiness of beggars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In time I shall make you believe in lots of
things,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;No. I hadn&#8217;t one sou to
buy a ticket, and Am&eacute;lie never left me. I spent my
last franc on the journey from Carcassonne to
Aigues-Mortes. Am&eacute;lie insisted on accompanying
me. She was taking no chances. Her eyes never
left me from the time we started. When I ran to
your assistance she was watching me from a house
on the other side of the <em>place</em>. She came to the
hotel while we were lunching. I thought I would
slip away unnoticed and join you after you had
made the <em>tour des remparts</em>. But no. I must present
her to my English friend. And then&mdash;<em>voyons</em>&mdash;didn&#8217;t
I tell you I never lost a visiting-card?
Look at this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
He dived into his pocket, produced the letter-case,
and extracted a card.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Voil&agrave;.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I read: &ldquo;The Duke of Wiltshire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, good heavens, man,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;that&#8217;s not
the card I gave you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it isn&#8217;t,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but it&#8217;s the one I
showed to Am&eacute;lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How on earth,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;did you come by the
Duke of Wiltshire&#8217;s visiting-card?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me roguishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;a&mdash;a &lsquo;snapper up of
unconsidered trifles.&rsquo; You see I know my Shakespeare.
I read &lsquo;The Winter&#8217;s Tale&rsquo; with some
French pupils to whom I was teaching English.
I love Autolycus. <em>C&#8217;est un peu moi, hein?</em> Anyhow,
I showed the Duke&#8217;s card to Am&eacute;lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I began to understand. &ldquo;That was why you
called me &lsquo;monseigneur&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally. And I told her that you were my
English patron, and would give me four thousand
francs as a wedding present if I accompanied you
to your agent&#8217;s at Montpellier, where you could
draw the money. Ah! But she was suspicious!
Yesterday I borrowed a bicycle. A friend left it in
the courtyard. I thought, &lsquo;I will creep out at dead
of night, when everyone&#8217;s asleep, and once on my
<em>petite bicyclette, bonsoir la compagnie</em>.&rsquo; But,
would you believe it? When I had dressed and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
crept down, and tried to mount the bicycle, I found
both tyres had been punctured in a hundred places
with the point of a pair of scissors. What do
you think of that, eh? Ah, <em>l&agrave;, l&agrave;!</em> it has been a
narrow escape. When you invited her to accompany
us to Montpellier my heart was in my
mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have served you right,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if she
had accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed as though, instead of not having a
penny, he had not a care in the world. Accustomed
to the geometrical conduct of my well-fed fellow-Britons,
who map out their lives by rule and line,
I had no measure whereby to gauge this amazing
and inconsequential person. In one way he had
acted abominably. To leave an affianced bride in
the lurch in this heartless manner was a most ungentlemanly
proceeding. On the other hand, an
unscrupulous adventurer would have married the
woman for her money and chanced the consequences.
In the tussle between Perseus and the
Gorgon the odds are all in favour of Perseus. Mercury
and Minerva, the most sharp-witted of the
gods, are helping him all the time&mdash;to say nothing
of the fact that Perseus starts out by being a notoriously
handsome fellow. So a handsome rogue
can generally wheedle an elderly, ugly wife into
opening her money-bags, and, if successful, leads
the enviable life of a fighting-cock. It was very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
much to his credit that this kind of life was not to
the liking of Aristide Pujol.</p>

<a name="img46" id="img46"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 303px;">

<span class="caption">&ldquo;i found both tyres had been punctured in a hundred places&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Indeed, speaking from affectionate knowledge of
the man, I can declare that the position in which he,
like many a better man, had placed himself was intolerable.
Other men of equal sensitiveness would
have extricated themselves in a more commonplace
fashion; but the dramatic appealed to my rascal,
and he has often plumed himself on his calculated
<em>coup de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</em> at the fork of the roads. He was
delighted with it. Even now I sometimes think that
Aristide Pujol will never grow up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s one thing I don&#8217;t understand,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and that is your astonishing influence over the
populace at Aigues-Mortes. You came upon them
like a firework&mdash;a devil-among-the-tailors&mdash;and
everybody, gendarmes and victim included, became
as tame as sheep. How was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed. &ldquo;I said you were my very old and
dear friend and patron, a great English duke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t quite see how that explanation satisfied
the pig-headed old gentleman whom I knocked
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; said Aristide Pujol, with a look of
indescribable drollery&mdash;&ldquo;that was my old father.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE ADVENTURE OF THE ARL&Eacute;SIENNE</strong></p>


<p>Aristide Pujol bade me a sunny farewell
at the door of the H&ocirc;tel du Luxembourg at
N&icirc;mes, and, valise in hand, darted off, in his
impetuous fashion, across the Place de l&#8217;Esplanade.
I felt something like a pang at the sight of his retreating
figure, as, on his own confession, he had
not a penny in the world. I wondered what he
would do for food and lodging, to say nothing of
tobacco, <em>ap&eacute;ritifs</em>, and other such necessaries of life.
The idea of so gay a creature starving was abhorrent.
Yet an invitation to stay as my guest at the
hotel until he saw an opportunity of improving his
financial situation he had courteously declined.</p>

<p>Early next morning I found him awaiting me in
the lounge and smoking an excellent cigar. He
explained that so dear a friend as myself ought to
be the first to hear the glad tidings. Last evening,
by the grace of Heaven, he had run across a bare
acquaintance, a manufacturer of nougat at Mont&eacute;limar;
had spent several hours in his company, with
the result that he had convinced him of two things:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
first, that the dry, crumbling, shortbread-like nougat
of Mont&eacute;limar was unknown in England, where
the population subsisted on a sickly, glutinous mess
whereto the medical faculty had ascribed the prevalent
dyspepsia of the population; and, secondly, that
the one Heaven-certified apostle who could spread
the glorious gospel of Mont&eacute;limar nougat over the
length and breadth of Great Britain and Ireland
was himself, Aristide Pujol. A handsome salary
had been arranged, of which he had already drawn
something on account&mdash;<em>hinc ille Colorado</em>&mdash;and he
was to accompany his principal the next day to
Mont&eacute;limar, <em>en route</em> for the conquest of Britain.
In the meantime he was as free as the winds, and
would devote the day to showing me the wonders
of the town.</p>

<p>I congratulated him on his almost fantastic good
fortune and gladly accepted his offer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing I should like to ask you,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;and it is this. Yesterday afternoon you
refused my cordially-offered hospitality, and went
away without a sou to bless yourself with. What
did you do? I ask out of curiosity. How does a
man set about trying to subsist on nothing at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s very simple,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Haven&#8217;t I told
you, and haven&#8217;t you seen for yourself, that I never
lose an opportunity? More than that. It has been
my rule in life either to make friends with the
Mammon of Unrighteousness&mdash;he&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
muddle-headed ass is Mammon, and you can steer clear of
his unrighteousness if you&#8217;re sharp enough&mdash;or else
to cast my bread upon the waters in the certainty
of finding it again after many days. In the case
in question I took the latter course. I cast my
bread a year or two ago upon the waters of the
Roman baths, which I will have the pleasure of
showing you this morning, and I found it again last
night at the H&ocirc;tel de la Curatterie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the course of the day he related to me the
following artless history.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Aristide Pujol arrived at N&icirc;mes one blazing day
in July. He had money in his pocket and laughter
in his soul. He had also deposited his valise at
the H&ocirc;tel du Luxembourg, which, as all the world
knows, is the most luxurious hotel in the town.
Joyousness of heart impelled him to a course of
action which the good N&icirc;mois regard as maniacal
in the sweltering July heat&mdash;he walked about the
baking streets for his own good pleasure.</p>

<p>Aristide Pujol was floating a company, a process
which afforded him as much delirious joy as the
floating, for the first time, of a toy yacht affords a
child. It was a company to build an hotel in Perpignan,
where the recent demolition of the fortifications
erected by the Emperor Charles V. had set
free a vast expanse of valuable building ground on
the other side of the little river on which the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
town is situated. The best hotel in Perpignan
being one to get away from as soon as possible,
owing to restriction of site, Aristide conceived the
idea of building a spacious and palatial hostelry
in the new part of the town, which should allure
all the motorists and tourists of the globe to that
Pyrenean Paradise. By sheer audacity he had contrived
to interest an eminent Paris architect in his
project. Now the man who listened to Aristide
Pujol was lost. With the glittering eye of the
Ancient Mariner he combined the winning charm
of a woman. For salvation, you either had to refuse
to see him, as all the architects to the end of
the R&#8217;s in the alphabetical list had done, or put
wax, Ulysses-like, in your ears, a precaution neglected
by the eminent M. Say. M. Say went to
Perpignan and returned in a state of subdued enthusiasm.</p>

<p>A limited company was formed, of which Aristide
Pujol, man of vast experience in affairs, was
managing director. But money came in slowly. A
financier was needed. Aristide looked through his
collection of visiting-cards, and therein discovered
that of a deaf ironmaster at St. &Eacute;tienne whose life
he had once saved at a railway station by dragging
him, as he was crossing the line, out of the way of
an express train that came thundering through.
Aristide, man of impulse, went straight to St.
&Eacute;tienne, to work upon the ironmaster&#8217;s sense of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
gratitude. Meanwhile, M. Say, man of more sober
outlook, bethought him of a client, an American
millionaire, passing through Paris, who had speculated
considerably in hotels. The millionaire, having
confidence in the eminent M. Say, thought well
of the scheme. He was just off to Japan, but would
drop down to the Pyrenees the next day and look
at the Perpignan site before boarding his steamer
at Marseilles. If his inquiries satisfied him, and he
could arrange matters with the managing director,
he would not mind putting a million dollars or so
into the concern. You must kindly remember that
I do not vouch for the literal accuracy of everything
told me by Aristide Pujol.</p>

<p>The question of the all-important meeting between
the millionaire and the managing director
then arose. As Aristide was at St. &Eacute;tienne it was
arranged that they should meet at a halfway stage
on the latter&#8217;s journey from Perpignan to Marseilles.
The H&ocirc;tel du Luxembourg at N&icirc;mes was
the place, and two o&#8217;clock on Thursday the time
appointed.</p>

<p>Meantime Aristide had found that the deaf ironmaster
had died months ago. This was a disappointment,
but fortune compensated him. This
part of his adventure is somewhat vague, but I
gathered that he was lured by a newly made acquaintance
into a gambling den, where he won the
prodigious sum of two thousand francs. With this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
wealth jingling and crinkling in his pockets he fled
the town and arrived at N&icirc;mes on Wednesday
morning, a day before his appointment.</p>

<p>That was why he walked joyously about the
blazing streets. The tide had turned at last. Of
the success of his interview with the millionaire he
had not the slightest doubt. He walked about
building gorgeous castles in Perpignan&mdash;which, by
the way, is not very far from Spain. Besides, as
you shall hear later, he had an account to settle
with the town of Perpignan. At last he reached
the Jardin de la Fontaine, the great, stately garden
laid out in complexity of terrace and bridge
and balustraded parapet over the waters of the
old Roman baths by the master hand to which
Louis XIV. had entrusted the Garden of Versailles.</p>

<p>Aristide threw himself on a bench and fanned
himself with his straw hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu!</em> it&#8217;s hot!&rdquo; he remarked to another
occupant of the seat.</p>

<p>This was a woman, and, as he saw when she
turned her face towards him, an exceedingly handsome
woman. Her white lawn and black silk headdress,
coming to a tiny crown just covering the
parting of her full, wavy hair, proclaimed her of the
neighboring town of Arles. She had all the
Arl&eacute;sienne&#8217;s Roman beauty&mdash;the finely chiselled
features, the calm, straight brows, the ripe lips, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
soft oval contour, the clear olive complexion. She
had also lustrous brown eyes; but these were full of
tears. She only turned them on him for a moment;
then she resumed her apparently interrupted
occupation of sobbing. Aristide was a soft-hearted
man. He drew nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you&#8217;re crying, madame!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; murmured the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To cry scalding tears in this weather! It&#8217;s too
hot! Now, if you could only cry iced water there
would be something refreshing in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You jest, monsieur,&rdquo; said the lady, drying her
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The sight of so beautiful
a woman in distress is painful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I am very unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide drew nearer still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the wretch that has dared to
make you so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband,&rdquo; replied the lady, swallowing a
sob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scoundrel!&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>The lady shrugged her shoulders and looked
down at her wedding-ring, which gleamed on a
slim, brown, perfectly kept hand. Aristide prided
himself on being a connoisseur in hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There never was a husband yet,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;who appreciated a beautiful wife. Husbands only
deserve harridans.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
&ldquo;That&#8217;s true,&rdquo; said the Arl&eacute;sienne, &ldquo;for when the
wife is good-looking they are jealous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is the trouble, is it?&rdquo; said Aristide.
&ldquo;Tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beautiful Arl&eacute;sienne again contemplated her
slender fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know you, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you soon will,&rdquo; said Aristide, in his pleasant
voice and with a laughing, challenging glance in his
bright eyes. She met it swiftly and sidelong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have been married to
my husband for four years, and have always been
faithful to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s praiseworthy,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I love him very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s unfortunate!&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently!&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>Their eyes met. They burst out laughing. The
lady quickly recovered and the tears sprang again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One can&#8217;t jest with a heavy heart; and mine is
very heavy.&rdquo; She broke down through self-pity.
&ldquo;Oh, I am ashamed!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>She turned away from him, burying her face in
her hands. Her dress, cut low, showed the nape
of her neck as it rose gracefully from her shoulders.
Two little curls had rebelled against being drawn
up with the rest of her hair. The back of a dainty
ear, set close to the head, was provoking in its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
pink loveliness. Her attitude, that of a youthful
Niobe, all tears, but at the same time all curves and
delicious contours, would have played the deuce
with an anchorite.</p>

<p>Aristide, I would have you remember, was a child
of the South. A child of the North, regarding a
bewitching woman, thinks how nice it would be to
make love to her, and wastes his time in wondering
how he can do it. A child of the South neither
thinks nor wonders; he makes love straight away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;you are adorable, and
I love you to distraction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started up. &ldquo;Monsieur, you forget yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I remember anything else in the wide world
but you, it would be a poor compliment. I forget
everything. You turn my head, you ravish my
heart, and you put joy into my soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He meant it&mdash;intensely&mdash;for the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought not to listen to you,&rdquo; said the lady,
&ldquo;especially when I am so unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the more reason to seek consolation,&rdquo; replied
Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, after a short pause, &ldquo;you
look good and loyal. I will tell you what is the
matter. My husband accuses me wrongfully, although
I know that appearances are against me.
He only allows me in the house on sufferance, and
is taking measures to procure a divorce.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;madame,&rdquo; said aristide, &ldquo;you are adorable, and i love you

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>A la bonne heure!</em>&rdquo; cried Aristide, excitedly casting
away his straw hat, which an unintentional
twist of the wrist caused to skim horizontally and
nearly decapitate a small and perspiring soldier
who happened to pass by. &ldquo;<em>A la bonne heure!</em>
Let him divorce you. You are then free. You
can be mine without any further question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I love my husband,&rdquo; she smiled, sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said he, with the scepticism of the lover
and the Proven&ccedil;al. &ldquo;And, by the way, who is your
husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is M. &Eacute;mile Bocardon, proprietor of the
H&ocirc;tel de la Curatterie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Mme. Bocardon,&rdquo; she replied, with the
faintest touch of roguery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your Christian name? How is it possible
for me to think of you as Mme. Bocardon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They argued the question. Eventually she confessed
to the name of Zette.</p>

<p>Her confidence not stopping there, she told him
how she came by the name; how she was brought
up by her Aunt L&eacute;onie at Raph&egrave;le, some five miles
from Arles, and many other unexciting particulars
of her early years. Her baptismal name was
Louise. Her mother, who died when she was
young, called her Louisette. Aunt L&eacute;onie, a very
busy woman, with no time for superfluous syllables,
called her Zette.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
&ldquo;Zette!&rdquo; He cast up his eyes as if she had been
canonized and he was invoking her in rapt worship.
&ldquo;Zette, I adore you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zette was extremely sorry. She, on her side,
adored the cruel M. Bocardon. Incidentally she
learned Aristide&#8217;s name and quality. He was an
<em>agent d&#8217;affaires</em>, extremely rich&mdash;had he not two
thousand francs and an American millionaire in
his pocket?</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Pujol,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the earth holds but one
thing that I desire, the love and trust of my husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good Bocardon is becoming tiresome,&rdquo; said
Aristide.</p>

<p>Zette&#8217;s lips parted, as she pointed to a black speck
at the iron entrance gates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu!</em> there he is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has become tiresome,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>She rose, displaying to its full advantage her
supple and stately figure. She had a queenly poise
of the head. Aristide contemplated her with the
frankest admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One would say Juno was walking the earth
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although Zette had never heard of Juno, and
was as miserable and heavy hearted a woman as
dwelt in N&icirc;mes, a flush of pleasure rose to her
cheeks. She too was a child of the South, and
female children of the South love to be admired, no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
matter how frankly. I have heard of Daughters of
the Snows not quite averse to it. She sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go now, monsieur. He must not find
me here with you. I am suffering enough already
from his reproaches. Ah! it is unjust&mdash;unjust!&rdquo;
she cried, clenching her hands, while the tears again
started into her eyes, and the corners of her pretty
lips twitched with pain. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I
know it has been wrong of me to talk to you like
this. But <em>que voulez-vous?</em> It was not my fault.
Adieu, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the sight of her standing before him in her
woeful beauty, Aristide&#8217;s pulses throbbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not adieu&mdash;it is <em>au revoir</em>, Mme. Zette,&rdquo; he
cried.</p>

<p>She protested tearfully. It was farewell. Aristide
darted to his rejected hat and clapped it on
the back of his head. He joined her and swore
that he would see her again. It was not Aristide
Pujol who would allow her to be rent in pieces by
the jaws of that crocodile, M. Bocardon. Faith,
he would defend her to the last drop of his blood.
He would do all manner of gasconading things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what can you do, my poor M. Pujol?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will see,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>They parted. He watched her until she became
a speck and, having joined the other speck, her
husband, passed out of sight. Then he set out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
through the burning gardens towards the H&ocirc;tel
du Luxembourg, at the other end of the town.</p>

<p>Aristide had fallen in love. He had fallen in
love with Proven&ccedil;al fury. He had done the same
thing a hundred times before; but this, he told himself,
was the <em>coup de foudre</em>&mdash;the thunderbolt.
The beautiful Arl&eacute;sienne filled his brain and his
senses. Nothing else in the wide world mattered.
Nothing else in the wide world occupied his mind.
He sped through the hot streets like a meteor in
human form. A stout man, sipping syrup and
water in the cool beneath the awning of the Caf&eacute;
de la Bourse, rose, looked wonderingly after him,
and resumed his seat, wiping a perspiring brow.</p>

<p>A short while afterwards Aristide, valise in hand,
presented himself at the bureau of the H&ocirc;tel de la
Curatterie. It was a shabby little hotel, with a
shabby little oval sign outside, and was situated in
the narrow street of the same name. Within, it was
clean and well kept. On the right of the little dark
entrance-hall was the <em>salle &agrave; manger</em>, on the left the
bureau and an unenticing hole labelled <em>salon de
correspondance</em>. A very narrow passage led to the
kitchen, and the rest of the hall was blocked by the
staircase. An enormous man with a simple, woe-begone
fat face and a head of hair like a circular
machine-brush was sitting by the bureau window
in his shirt-sleeves. Aristide addressed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Bocardon?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
&ldquo;At your service, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I have a bedroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; He waved a hand towards a set of
black sample boxes studded with brass nails and
bound with straps that lay in the hall. &ldquo;The omnibus
has brought your boxes. You are M. Lambert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Bocardon,&rdquo; said Aristide, in a lordly way, &ldquo;I
am M. Aristide Pujol, and not a commercial
traveller. I have come to see the beauties of N&icirc;mes,
and have chosen this hotel because I have the
honour to be a distant relation of your wife, Mme.
Zette Bocardon, whom I have not seen for many
years. How is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her health is very good,&rdquo; replied M. Bocardon,
shortly. He rang a bell.</p>

<p>A dilapidated man in a green baize apron
emerged from the dining-room and took Aristide&#8217;s
valise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. 24,&rdquo; said M. Bocardon. Then, swinging
his massive form halfway through the narrow
bureau door, he called down the passage, &ldquo;Euph&eacute;mie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A woman&#8217;s voice responded, and in a moment the
woman herself appeared, a pallid, haggard, though
more youthful, replica of Zette, with the dark
rings of sleeplessness or illness beneath her eyes
which looked furtively at the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell your sister,&rdquo; said M. Bocardon, &ldquo;that a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
relation of yours has come to stay in the
hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He swung himself back into the bureau and took
no further notice of the guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A relation?&rdquo; echoed Euph&eacute;mie, staring at the
smiling, lustrous-eyed Aristide, whose busy brain
was wondering how he could mystify this unwelcome
and unexpected sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Aristide, cousin to your good Aunt
L&eacute;onie at Raph&egrave;le. Ah&mdash;but you are too young
to remember me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell Zette,&rdquo; she said, disappearing down
the narrow passage.</p>

<p>Aristide went to the doorway, and stood there
looking out into the not too savoury street. On
the opposite side, which was in the shade, the
tenants of the modest little shops sat by their doors
or on chairs on the pavement. There was considerable
whispering among them and various
glances were cast at him. Presently footsteps behind
caused him to turn. There was Zette. She
had evidently been weeping since they had parted,
for her eyelids were red. She started on beholding
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed and shook her hesitating hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I, Aristide. But you have grown! <em>P&eacute;ca&iuml;re!</em>
How you have grown!&rdquo; He swung her hands apart
and laughed merrily in her bewildered eyes. &ldquo;To
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
think that the little Zette in pigtails and short check
skirt should have grown into this beautiful woman!
I compliment you on your wife, M. Bocardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>M. Bocardon did not reply, but Aristide&#8217;s swift
glance noticed a spasm of pain shoot across his
broad face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the good Aunt L&eacute;onie? Is she well? And
does she still make her <em>matelotes</em> of eels? Ah,
they were good, those <em>matelotes</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt L&eacute;onie died two years ago,&rdquo; said Zette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor woman! And I who never knew.
Tell me about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <em>salle &agrave; manger</em> door stood open. He drew
her thither by his curious fascination. They entered,
and he shut the door behind them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Voil&agrave;!</em>&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Didn&#8217;t I tell you I should
see you again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Vous avez un fameux toupet, vous!</em>&rdquo; said Zette,
half angrily.</p>

<p>He laughed, having been accused of confounded
impudence many times before in the course of his
adventurous life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I told my husband he would kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely. So you&#8217;re not going to tell him. I
adore you. I have come to protect you. <em>Foi de
Proven&ccedil;al.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only way to protect me is to prove my innocence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
She drew herself up and looked him straight between
the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll recognize that you have a loyal heart, and
will be your very good friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mme. Zette,&rdquo; cried Aristide, &ldquo;I will devote my
life to your service. Tell me the particulars of the
affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask M. Bocardon.&rdquo; She left him, and sailed out
of the room and past the bureau with her proud
head in the air.</p>

<p>If Aristide Pujol had the rapturous idea of proving
the innocence of Mme. Zette, triumphing over
the fat pig of a husband, and eventually, in a fantastic
fashion, carrying off the insulted and spotless
lady to some bower of delight (the castle in Perpignan&mdash;why
not?), you must blame, not him, but
Provence, whose sons, if not devout, are frankly
pagan. Sometimes they are both.</p>

<p>M. Bocardon sat in his bureau, pretending to do
accounts and tracing columns of figures with a
huge, trembling forefinger. He looked the picture
of woe. Aristide decided to bide his opportunity.
He went out into the streets again, now with the
object of killing time. The afternoon had advanced,
and trees and buildings cast cool shadows
in which one could walk with comfort; and N&icirc;mes,
clear, bright city of wide avenues and broad open
spaces, instinct too with the grandeur that was
Rome&#8217;s, is an idler&#8217;s Paradise. Aristide knew it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
well; but he never tired of it. He wandered round
the Maison Carr&eacute;e, his responsive nature delighting
in the splendour of the Temple, with its fluted Corinthian
columns, its noble entablature, its massive
pediment, its perfect proportions; reluctantly turned
down the Boulevard Victor Hugo, past the Lyc&eacute;e
and the Bourse, made the circuit of the mighty,
double-arched oval of the Arena, and then retraced
his steps. As he expected, M. Bocardon had left
the bureau. It was the hour of absinthe. The
porter named M. Bocardon&#8217;s habitual caf&eacute;. There,
in a morose corner of the terrace, Aristide found the
huge man gloomily contemplating an absurdly small
glass of the bitters known as Dubonnet. Aristide
raised his hat, asked permission to join him, and
sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Bocardon,&rdquo; said he, carefully mixing the
absinthe which he had ordered, &ldquo;I learn from my
fair cousin that there is between you a regrettable
misunderstanding, for which I am sincerely sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She calls it a misunderstanding?&rdquo; He laughed
mirthlessly. &ldquo;Women have their own vocabulary.
Listen, my good sir. There is infamy between us.
When a wife betrays a man like me&mdash;kind, indulgent,
trustful, who has worshipped the ground she
treads on&mdash;it is not a question of misunderstanding.
It is infamy. If she had anywhere to lay her
head, I would turn her out of doors to-night. But
she has not. You, who are her relative, know I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
married her without a dowry. You alone of her
family survive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Aristide&#8217;s impulsive tongue
to say that he would be only too willing to shelter
her, but prudently he refrained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has broken my heart,&rdquo; continued Bocardon.</p>

<p>Aristide asked for details of the unhappy affair.
The large man hesitated for a moment and glanced
suspiciously at his companion; but, fascinated by
the clear, luminous eyes, he launched with Southern
violence into a whirling story. The villain was a
traveller in buttons&mdash;<em>buttons!</em> To be wronged by
a traveller in diamonds might have its compensations&mdash;but
buttons! Linen buttons, bone buttons,
brass buttons, <em>trouser buttons!</em> To be a traveller
in the inanity of buttonholes was the only lower
degradation. His name was Bondon&mdash;he uttered
it scathingly, as if to decline from a Bocardon to a
Bondon was unthinkable. This Bondon was a regular
client of the hotel, and such a client!&mdash;who
never ordered a bottle of <em>vin cachet&eacute;</em> or coffee or
cognac. A contemptible creature. For a long time
he had his suspicions. Now he was certain. He
tossed off his glass of Dubonnet, ordered another,
and spoke incoherently of the opening and shutting
of doors, whisperings, of a dreadful incident, the
central fact of which was a glimpse of Zette gliding
wraith-like down a corridor. Lastly, there
was the culminating proof, a letter found that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
morning in Zette&#8217;s room. He drew a crumpled
sheet from his pocket and handed it to Aristide.</p>

<a name="img70" id="img70"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 427px;">
<img src="images/img070.jpg" width="427" height="500" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;the villain was a traveller in buttons&mdash;buttons!&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>It was a crude, flaming, reprehensible, and entirely
damning epistle. Aristide turned cold, shivering
at the idea of the superb and dainty Zette
coming in contact with such abomination. He
hated Bondon with a murderous hate. He drank
a great gulp of absinthe and wished it were Bondon&#8217;s
blood. Great tears rolled down Bocardon&#8217;s
face, and gathering at the ends of his scrubby
moustache dripped in splashes on the marble table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I loved her so tenderly, monsieur,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>The cry, so human, went straight to Aristide&#8217;s
heart. A sympathetic tear glistened in his bright
eyes. He was suddenly filled with an immense pity
for this grief-stricken, helpless giant. An odd feminine
streak ran through his nature and showed
itself in queer places. Impulsively he stretched out
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re going?&rdquo; asked Bocardon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. A sign of good friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They gripped hands across the table. A new
emotion thrilled through the facile Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bocardon, I devote myself to you,&rdquo; he cried,
with a flamboyant gesture. &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, nothing,&rdquo; replied the other, miserably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Zette? What does she say to it all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mountainous shoulders heaved with a shrug.
&ldquo;She denies everything. She had never seen the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
letter until I showed it to her. She did not know
how it came into her room. As if that were possible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s improbable,&rdquo; said Aristide, gloomily.</p>

<p>They talked. Bocardon, in a choking voice, told
the simple tale of their married happiness. It had
been a love-match, different from the ordinary marriages
of reason and arrangement. Not a cloud
since their wedding-day. They were called the turtle-doves
of the Rue de la Curatterie. He had not
even manifested the jealousy justifiable in the possessor
of so beautiful a wife. He had trusted her
implicitly. He was certain of her love. That was
enough. They had had one child, who died. Grief
had brought them even nearer each other. And
now this stroke had been dealt. It was a
knife being turned round in his heart. It was
agony.</p>

<p>They walked back to the hotel together. Zette,
who was sitting by the desk in the bureau, rose and,
without a word or look, vanished down the passage.
Bocardon, with a great sigh, took her place. It
was dinner-time. The half-dozen guests and frequenters
filled for a moment the little hall, some
waiting to wash their hands at the primitive <em>lavabo</em>
by the foot of the stairs. Aristide accompanied
them into the <em>salle &agrave; manger</em>, where he dined in
solemn silence. The dinner over he went out again,
passing by the bureau where Bocardon, in its dim
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
recesses, was eating a sad meal brought to him by
the melancholy Euph&eacute;mie. Zette, he conjectured,
was dining in the kitchen. An atmosphere of desolation
impregnated the place, as though a corpse
were somewhere in the house.</p>

<p>Aristide drank his coffee at the nearest caf&eacute; in
a complicated state of mind. He had fallen furiously
in love with the lady, believing her to be the
victim of a jealous husband. In an outburst of
generous emotion he had taken the husband to his
heart, seeing that he was a good man stricken to
death. Now he loved the lady, loved the husband,
and hated the villain Bondon. What Aristide felt,
he felt fiercely. He would reconcile these two
people he loved, and then go and, if not assassinate
Bondon, at least do him some bodily injury. With
this idea in his head, he paid for his coffee and went
back to the hotel.</p>

<p>He found Zette taking her turn at the bureau,
for clients have to be attended to, even in the most
distressing circumstances. She was talking to a
new arrival, trying to smile a welcome. Aristide,
loitering near, watched her beautiful face, to which
the perfect classic features gave an air of noble
purity. His soul revolted at the idea of her mixing
herself up with a sordid wretch like Bondon. It
was unbelievable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Eh bien</em>?&rdquo; she said as soon as they were
alone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mme. Zette, to-day I called your husband a
scoundrel and a crocodile. I was wrong. I find
him a man with a beautiful nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&#8217;t tell me that, M. Aristide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are breaking his heart, Mme. Zette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is he not breaking mine? He has told you,
I suppose. Am I responsible for what I know
nothing more about than a babe unborn? You
don&#8217;t believe I am speaking the truth? Bah! And
your professions this afternoon? Wind and gas,
like the words of all men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mme. Zette,&rdquo; cried Aristide, &ldquo;I said I would
devote my life to your service, and so I will. I&#8217;ll
go and find Bondon and kill him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He watched her narrowly, but she did not grow
pale like a woman whose lover is threatened with
mortal peril. She said dryly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better have some conversation with
him first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he to be found?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;How do I know?
He left by the early train this morning that goes
in the direction of Tarascon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then to-morrow,&rdquo; said Aristide, who knew the
ways of commercial travellers, &ldquo;he will be at Tarascon,
or at Avignon, or at Arles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard him say that he had just done Arles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tant mieux.</em> I shall find him either at Tarascon
or Avignon. And by the Tarasque of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Sainte-Marthe, I&#8217;ll bring you his head and you can put it
up outside as a sign and call the place the &lsquo;H&ocirc;tel
de la T&ecirc;te Bondon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<a name="img76" id="img76"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/img076.jpg" width="454" height="600" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">he burst into shrieks of laughter</span>
</div>

<p>Early the next morning Aristide started on his
quest, without informing the good Bocardon of
his intentions. He would go straight to Avignon,
as the more likely place. Inquiries at the various
hotels would soon enable him to hunt down his
quarry; and then&mdash;he did not quite know what
would happen then&mdash;but it would be something
picturesque, something entirely unforeseen by Bondon,
something to be thrillingly determined by the
inspiration of the moment. In any case he would
wipe the stain from the family escutcheon. By this
time he had convinced himself that he belonged to
the Bocardon family.</p>

<p>The only other occupant of the first-class compartment
was an elderly Englishwoman of sour
aspect. Aristide, his head full of Zette and Bondon,
scarcely noticed her. The train started and
sped through the sunny land of vine and olive.</p>

<p>They had almost reached Tarascon when a sudden
thought hit him between the eyes, like the blow
of a fist. He gasped for a moment, then he burst
into shrieks of laughter, kicking his legs up and
down and waving his arms in maniacal mirth.
After that he rose and danced. The sour-faced
Englishwoman, in mortal terror, fled into the corridor.
She must have reported Aristide&#8217;s behaviour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to the guard, for in a minute or two that official
appeared at the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Qu&#8217;est-ce qu&#8217;il y a?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide paused in his demonstrations of merriment.
&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have just discovered
what I am going to do to M. Bondon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Delight bubbled out of him as he walked from
the Avignon Railway Station up the Cours de
la R&eacute;publique. The wretch Bondon lay at his
mercy. He had not proceeded far, however, when
his quick eye caught sight of an object in the ramshackle
display of a curiosity dealer&#8217;s. He paused
in front of the window, fascinated. He rubbed
his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is not a dream. The <em>bon Dieu</em>
is on my side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went into the shop and bought the object.
It was a pair of handcuffs.</p>

<p>At a little after three o&#8217;clock the small and dilapidated
hotel omnibus drove up before the H&ocirc;tel de
la Curatterie, and from it descended Aristide Pujol,
radiant-eyed, and a scrubby little man with a
goatee beard, pince-nez, and a dome-like forehead,
who, pale and trembling, seemed stricken with a
great fear. It was Bondon. Together they entered
the little hall. As soon as Bocardon saw his
enemy his eyes blazed with fury, and, uttering an
inarticulate roar, he rushed out of the bureau
with clenched fists murderously uplifted. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
terrified Bondon shrank into a corner, protected by
Aristide, who, smiling like an angel of peace, intercepted
the onslaught of the huge man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be calm, my good Bocardon, be calm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bocardon would not be calm. He found
his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, scoundrel! Miscreant! Wretch! Traitor!&rdquo;
When his vocabulary of vituperation and his breath
failed him, he paused and mopped his forehead.</p>

<p>Bondon came a step or two forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, monsieur, I have all the wrong on my
side. Your anger is justifiable. But I never
dreamt of the disastrous effect of my acts. Let
me see her, my good M. Bocardon, I beseech you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let you see her?&rdquo; said Bocardon, growing purple
in the face.</p>

<p>At this moment Zette came running up the passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is all this noise about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madame!&rdquo; cried Bondon, eagerly, &ldquo;I am
heart-broken. You who are so kind&mdash;let me see
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Hein</em>?&rdquo; exclaimed Bocardon, in stupefaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See whom?&rdquo; asked Zette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear dead one. My dear Euph&eacute;mie, who
has committed suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he&#8217;s mad!&rdquo; shouted Bocardon, in his great
voice. &ldquo;Euph&eacute;mie! Euph&eacute;mie! Come here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the sight of Euph&eacute;mie, pale and shivering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
with apprehension, Bondon sank upon a bench by
the wall. He stared at her as if she were a ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t understand,&rdquo; he murmured, faintly,
looking like a trapped hare at Aristide Pujol, who,
debonair, hands on hips, stood a little way apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I, either,&rdquo; cried Bocardon.</p>

<p>A great light dawned on Zette&#8217;s beautiful face.
&ldquo;I do understand.&rdquo; She exchanged glances with
Aristide. He came forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s very simple,&rdquo; said he, taking the stage with
childlike exultation. &ldquo;I go to find Bondon this
morning to kill him. In the train I have a sudden
inspiration, a revelation from Heaven. It is not
Zette but Euph&eacute;mie that is the <em>bonne amie</em> of Bondon.
I laugh, and frighten a long-toothed English
old maid out of her wits. Shall I get out at Tarascon
and return to N&icirc;mes and tell you, or shall
I go on? I decide to go on. I make my plan. Ah,
but when I make a plan, it&#8217;s all in a second, a flash,
<em>pfuit!</em> At Avignon I see a pair of handcuffs. I
buy them. I spend hours tracking that animal
there. At last I find him at the station about to
start for Lyon. I tell him I am a police agent.
I let him see the handcuffs, which convince him.
I tell him Euph&eacute;mie, in consequence of the discovery
of his letter, has committed suicide. There
is a <em>proc&egrave;s-verbal</em> at which he is wanted. I summon
him to accompany me in the name of the law&mdash;and
there he is.&rdquo;</p>

<a name="img82" id="img82"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/img082.jpg" width="449" height="600" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;and you!&rdquo; shouted bocardon, falling on aristide; &ldquo;i must
embrace you also&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then that letter was not for my wife?&rdquo; said
Bocardon, who was not quick-witted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, no, imbecile!&rdquo; cried Aristide.</p>

<p>Bocardon hugged his wife in his vast embrace.
The tears ran down his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my little Zette, my little Zette, will you
ever pardon me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Oui, je te pardonne, gros jaloux</em>,&rdquo; said Zette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you!&rdquo; shouted Bocardon, falling on Aristide;
&ldquo;I must embrace you also.&rdquo; He kissed him
on both cheeks, in his expansive way, and thrust
him towards Zette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can also kiss my wife. It is I, Bocardon,
who command it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fire of a not ignoble pride raced through
Aristide&#8217;s veins. He was a hero. He knew it. It
was a moment worth living.</p>

<p>The embraces and other expressions of joy and
gratitude being temporarily suspended, attention
was turned to the unheroic couple who up to then
had said not one word to each other. The explanation
of their conduct, too, was simple, apparently.
They were in love. She had no dowry. He could
not marry her, as his parents would not give their
consent. She, for her part, was frightened to
death by the discovery of the letter, lest Bocardon
should turn her out of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What dowry will satisfy your parents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing less than twelve thousand francs.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
&ldquo;I give it,&rdquo; said Bocardon, reckless in his newly-found
happiness. &ldquo;Marry her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clock in the bureau struck four. Aristide
pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Saperlipopette!</em>&rdquo; he cried, and disappeared like
a flash into the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&#8217;s the matter with him?&rdquo; shouted Bocardon,
in amazement.</p>

<p>Zette went to the door. &ldquo;He&#8217;s running as if he
had the devil at his heels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he always like that?&rdquo; asked her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How always?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Parbleu!</em> When you used to see him at your
Aunt L&eacute;onie&#8217;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zette flushed red. To repudiate the saviour of
her entire family were an act of treachery too
black for her ingenuous heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she replied, calmly, coming back
into the hall. &ldquo;We used to call him Cousin Quicksilver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the big avenue Aristide hailed a passing cab.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the H&ocirc;tel du Luxembourg&mdash;at a gallop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the joyous excitement of the past few hours
this child of impulse and sunshine, this dragon-fly
of a man, had entirely forgotten the appointment
at two o&#8217;clock with the American millionaire and
the fortune that depended on it. He would be
angry at being kept waiting. Aristide had met
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Americans before. His swift brain invented an
elaborate excuse.</p>

<p>He leaped from the cab and entered the vestibule
of the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I see M. Congleton?&rdquo; he asked at the bureau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An American gentleman? He has gone, monsieur.
He left by the three-thirty train. Are you
M. Pujol? There is a letter for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sinking heart he opened it and read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I was in this hotel at two o&#8217;clock,
according to arrangement. As my last train to
Japan leaves at three-thirty, I regret I cannot await
your convenience. The site of the hotel is satisfactory.
Your business methods are not. I am
sorry, therefore, not to be able to entertain the
matter further.&mdash;Faithfully,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;" class="smcap">William B. Congleton.</span></p></div>

<p>He stared at the words for a few paralyzed moments.
Then he stuffed the letter into his pocket
and broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Zut!</em>&rdquo; said he, using the inelegant expletive
whereby a Frenchman most adequately expresses
his scorn of circumstance. &ldquo;<em>Zut!</em> If I have lost
a fortune, I have gained two devoted friends, so
I am the winner on the day&#8217;s work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon he returned gaily to the bosom of
the Bocardon family and remained there, its Cousin
Quicksilver and its entirely happy and idolized hero,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
until the indignation of the eminent M. Say summoned
him to Paris.</p>

<p>And that is how Aristide Pujol could live thenceforward
on nothing at all at N&icirc;mes, whenever it
suited him to visit that historic town.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE ADVENTURE OF THE KIND MR. SMITH</strong></p>


<p>Aristide Pujol started life on his own
account as a <em>chasseur</em> in a Nice caf&eacute;&mdash;one
of those luckless children tightly encased
in bottle-green cloth by means of brass buttons,
who earn a sketchy livelihood by enduring with
cherubic smiles the continuous maledictions of the
establishment. There he soothed his hours of servitude
by dreams of vast ambitions. He would become
the manager of a great hotel&mdash;not a contemptible
hostelry where commercial travellers and
seedy Germans were indifferently bedded, but one
of those white palaces where milords (English) and
millionaires (American) paid a thousand francs a
night for a bedroom and five louis for a glass of
beer. Now, in order to derive such profit from the
Anglo-Saxon a knowledge of English was indispensable.
He resolved to learn the language. How
he did so, except by sheer effrontery, taking linguistic
toll of frequenters of the caf&eacute;, would be a
mystery to anyone unacquainted with Aristide. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
to his friends his mastery of the English tongue
in such circumstances is comprehensible. To Aristide
the impossible was ever the one thing easy of
attainment; the possible the one thing he never
could achieve. That was the paradoxical nature
of the man. Before his days of hunted-little-devildom
were over he had acquired sufficient knowledge
of English to carry him, a few years later,
through various vicissitudes in England, until, fired
by new social ambitions and self-educated in a
haphazard way, he found himself appointed Professor
of French in an academy for young ladies.</p>

<p>One of these days, when I can pin my dragon-fly
friend down to a plain, unvarnished autobiography,
I may be able to trace some chronological
sequence in the kaleidoscopic changes in his career.
But hitherto, in his talks with me, he flits about from
any one date to any other during a couple of decades,
in a manner so confusing that for the present
I abandon such an attempt. All I know of the
date of the episode I am about to chronicle is that
it occurred immediately after the termination of
his engagement at the academy just mentioned.
Somehow, Aristide&#8217;s history is a category of terminations.</p>

<p>If the head mistress of the academy had herself
played dragon at his classes, all would have gone
well. He would have made his pupils conjugate
irregular verbs, rendered them adepts in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
mysteries of the past participle and the subjunctive
mood, and turned them out quite innocent of the
idiomatic quaintnesses of the French tongue. But
<em>dis aliter visum</em>. The gods always saw wrong-headedly
otherwise in the case of Aristide. A
weak-minded governess&mdash;and in a governess a
sense of humour and of novelty is always a sign
of a weak mind&mdash;played dragon during Aristide&#8217;s
lessons. She appreciated his method, which was
colloquial. The colloquial Aristide was jocular.
His lessons therefore were a giggling joy from beginning
to end. He imparted to his pupils delicious
knowledge. <em>En avez-vous des-z-homards?
Oh, les sales b&ecirc;tes, elles ont du poil aux pattes</em>,
which, being translated, is: &ldquo;Have you any lobsters?
Oh, the dirty animals, they have hair on
their feet&rdquo;&mdash;a catch phrase which, some years ago,
added greatly to the gaiety of Paris, but in which
I must confess to seeing no gleam of wit&mdash;became
the historic property of the school. He recited to
them, till they were word-perfect, a music-hall ditty
of the early &#8217;eighties&mdash;<em>Sur le bi, sur le banc, sur
le bi du bout du banc</em>, and delighted them with dissertations
on Mme. Yvette Guilbert&#8217;s earlier repertoire.
But for him they would have gone to their
lives&#8217; end without knowing that <em>pognon</em> meant
money; <em>rousp&eacute;tance</em>, assaulting the police; <em>thune</em>,
a five-franc piece; and <em>bouffer</em>, to take nourishment.
He made (according to his own statement) French
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
a living language. There was never a school in
Great Britain, the Colonies, or America on which
the Parisian accent was so electrically impressed.
The retort, <em>Eh! ta s&oelig;ur</em>, was the purest Montmartre;
also <em>Fich&#8217;-moi la paix, mon petit</em>, and <em>Tu as
un toupet, toi</em>; and the delectable locution, <em>Allons
&eacute;trangler un perroquet</em> (let us strangle a parrot),
employed by Apaches when inviting each other to
drink a glass of absinthe, soon became current
French in the school for invitations to surreptitious
cocoa-parties.</p>

<p>The progress that academy made in a real grip
of the French language was miraculous; but the
knowledge it gained in French grammar and syntax
was deplorable. A certain mid-term examination&mdash;the
paper being set by a neighbouring vicar&mdash;produced
awful results. The phrase, &ldquo;How do you do,
dear?&rdquo; which ought, by all the rules of Stratford-atte-Bowe,
to be translated by <em>Comment vous portez-vous,
ma ch&egrave;re?</em> was rendered by most of the
senior scholars <em>Eh, ma vieille, ca boulotte?</em> One
innocent and anachronistic damsel, writing on the
execution of Charles I., declared that he <em>cracha
dans le panier</em> in 1649, thereby mystifying the good
vicar, who was unaware that &ldquo;to spit into the basket&rdquo;
is to be guillotined. This wealth of vocabulary
was discounted by abject poverty in other
branches of the language. No one could give a list
of the words in &ldquo;<em>al</em>&rdquo; that took &ldquo;<em>s</em>&rdquo; in the plural,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
no one knew anything at all about the defective
verb <em>&eacute;choir</em>, and the orthography of the school
would have disgraced a kindergarten. The head
mistress suspected a lack of method in the teaching
of M. Pujol, and one day paid his class a surprise
visit.</p>

<p>The sight that met her eyes petrified her. The
class, including the governess, bubbled and gurgled
and shrieked with laughter. M. Pujol, his bright
eyes agleam with merriment and his arms moving
in frantic gestures, danced about the platform. He
was telling them a story&mdash;and when Aristide told
a story, he told it with the eloquence of his entire
frame. He bent himself double and threw out his
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Il &eacute;tait sao&ucirc;l comme un porc</em>,&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>And then came the hush of death. The rest of
the artless tale about the man as drunk as a pig
was never told. The head mistress, indignant majesty,
strode up the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Pujol, you have a strange way of giving
French lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe, madame,&rdquo; said he, with a polite bow,
&ldquo;in interesting my pupils in their studies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pupils have to be taught, not interested,&rdquo; said
the head mistress. &ldquo;Will you kindly put the class
through some irregular verbs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So for the remainder of the lesson Aristide, under
the freezing eyes of the head mistress, put his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
sorrowful class through irregular verbs, of which
his own knowledge was singularly inexact, and at
the end received his dismissal. In vain he argued.
Outraged Minerva was implacable. Go he must.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We find him, then, one miserable December evening,
standing on the arrival platform of Euston
Station (the academy was near Manchester), an
unwonted statue of dubiety. At his feet lay his
meagre valise; in his hand was an enormous bouquet,
a useful tribute of esteem from his disconsolate
pupils; around him luggage-laden porters
and passengers hurried; in front were drawn up the
long line of cabs, their drivers&#8217; waterproofs glistening
with wet; and in his pocket rattled the few
paltry coins that, for Heaven knew how long, were
to keep him from starvation. Should he commit
the extravagance of taking a cab or should he go
forth, valise in hand, into the pouring rain? He
hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sacr&eacute; mille cochons! Quel chien de climat!</em>&rdquo;
he muttered.</p>

<p>A smart footman standing by turned quickly
and touched his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, sir; I&#8217;m from Mr. Smith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m glad to hear it, my friend,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re the French gentleman from Manchester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<a name="img94" id="img94"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 311px;">
<img src="images/img094.jpg" width="311" height="600" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">standing on the arrival platform of euston station</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then, sir, Mr. Smith has sent the carriage for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s very kind of him,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>The footman picked up the valise and darted
down the platform. Aristide followed. The footman
held invitingly open the door of a cosy
brougham. Aristide paused for the fraction of
a second. Who was this hospitable Mr. Smith?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;the best way of
finding out is to go and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He entered the carriage, sank back luxuriously
on the soft cushions, and inhaled the warm smell
of leather. They started, and soon the pelting rain
beat harmlessly against the windows. Aristide
looked out at the streaming streets, and, hugging
himself comfortably, thanked Providence and Mr.
Smith. But who was Mr. Smith? <em>Tiens</em>, thought
he, there were two little Miss Smiths at the academy;
he had pitied them because they had chilblains,
freckles, and perpetual colds in their heads;
possibly this was their kind papa. But, after all,
what did it matter whose papa he was? He was
expecting him. He had sent the carriage for him.
Evidently a well-bred and attentive person. And
<em>tiens!</em> there was even a hot-water can on the floor
of the brougham. &ldquo;He thinks of everything, that
man,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;I feel I am going to like
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carriage stopped at a house in Hampstead,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
standing, as far as he could see in the darkness,
in its own grounds. The footman opened the door
for him to alight and escorted him up the front
steps. A neat parlour-maid received him in a comfortably-furnished
hall and took his hat and greatcoat
and magnificent bouquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith hasn&#8217;t come back yet from the City,
sir; but Miss Christabel is in the drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;Please give me back my
bouquet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maid showed him into the drawing-room.
A pretty girl of three-and-twenty rose from a fender-stool
and advanced smilingly to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, M. le Baron. I was wondering
whether Thomas would spot you. I&#8217;m so glad he
did. You see, neither father nor I could give him
any description, for we had never seen you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This fitted in with his theory. But why Baron?
After all, why not? The English loved titles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems to be an intelligent fellow, mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a span of silence. The girl looked
at the bouquet, then at Aristide, who looked at the
girl, then at the bouquet, then at the girl again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will you deign to accept
these flowers as a token of my respectful
homage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Christabel took the flowers and blushed
prettily. She had dark hair and eyes and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
fascinating, upturned little nose, and the kindest little
mouth in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Englishman would not have thought of
that,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Aristide smiled in his roguish way and raised a
deprecating hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he would. But he would not have
had&mdash;what you call the cheek to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Christabel laughed merrily, invited him
to a seat by the fire, and comforted him with
tea and hot muffins. The frank charm of his girl-hostess
captivated Aristide and drove from his
mind the riddle of his adventure. Besides, think of
the Arabian Nights&#8217; enchantment of the change
from his lonely and shabby bed-sitting-room in the
Rusholme Road to this fragrant palace with
princess and all to keep him company! He watched
the firelight dancing through her hair, the dainty
play of laughter over her face, and decided that
the brougham had transported him to Bagdad instead
of Hampstead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have the air of a veritable princess,&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I once met a princess&mdash;at a charity bazaar&mdash;and
she was a most matter-of-fact, businesslike
person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;A princess of a charity
bazaar! I was talking of the princess in a fairytale.
They are the only real ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Miss Christabel, &ldquo;that
when men pay such compliments to English girls
they are apt to get laughed at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Englishmen, yes,&rdquo; replied Aristide, &ldquo;because
they think over a compliment for a week, so that
by the time they pay it, it is addled, like a bad egg.
But we of Provence pay tribute to beauty straight
out of our hearts. It is true. It is sincere. And
what comes out of the heart is not ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the girl coloured and laughed. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve always
heard that a Frenchman makes love to every
woman he meets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;If they are pretty.
What else are pretty women for? Otherwise they
might as well be hideous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the girl, to whom this Proven&ccedil;al
point of view had not occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, if I make love to you, it is but your due.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what my fianc&eacute; would say if he heard
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fianc&eacute;! There&#8217;s his photograph on the
table beside you. He is six foot one, and so jealous!&rdquo;
she laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Turk!&rdquo; cried Aristide, his swiftly-conceived
romance crumbling into dust. Then he brightened
up. &ldquo;But when this six feet of muscle and egotism
is absent, surely other poor mortals can glean a
smile?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
&ldquo;You will observe that I&#8217;m not frowning,&rdquo; said
Miss Christabel. &ldquo;But you must not call my fianc&eacute;
a Turk, for he&#8217;s a very charming fellow whom I
hope you&#8217;ll like very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide sighed. &ldquo;And the name of this thrice-blessed
mortal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Christabel told his name&mdash;one Harry Ralston&mdash;and
not only his name, but, such was the
peculiar, childlike charm of Aristide Pujol, also
many other things about him. He was the Honourable
Harry Ralston, the heir to a great brewery
peerage, and very wealthy. He was a member
of Parliament, and but for Parliamentary duties
would have dined there that evening; but he
was to come in later, as soon as he could leave the
House. He also had a house in Hampshire, full of
the most beautiful works of art. It was through
their common hobby that her father and Harry had
first made acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re supposed to have a very fine collection
here,&rdquo; she said, with a motion of her hand.</p>

<p>Aristide looked round the walls and saw them
hung with pictures in gold frames. In those days
he had not acquired an extensive culture. Besides,
who having before him the firelight gleaming
through Miss Christabel&#8217;s hair could waste his
time over painted canvas? She noted his cursory
glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were a connoisseur?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Aristide, his bright eyes fixed on
her in frank admiration.</p>

<p>She blushed again; but this time she rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go and dress for dinner. Perhaps you
would like to be shown your room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hung his head on one side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I been too bold, mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You see, I&#8217;ve never
met a Frenchman before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then a world of undreamed-of homage is at
your feet,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>A servant ushered him up broad, carpeted staircases
into a bedroom such as he had never seen in
his life before. It was all curtains and hangings
and rugs and soft couches and satin quilts and
dainty writing-tables and subdued lights, and a
great fire glowed red and cheerful, and before it
hung a clean shirt. His poor little toilet apparatus
was laid on the dressing-table, and (with a
tact which he did not appreciate, for he had, sad
to tell, no dress-suit) the servant had spread his
precious frock-coat and spare pair of trousers on
the bed. On the pillow lay his night-shirt, neatly
folded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; said Aristide, impressed by these
preparations, &ldquo;it is expected that I wash myself
now and change my clothes, and that I sleep here
for the night. And for all that the ravishing
Miss Christabel is engaged to her honourable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Harry, this is none the less a corner of Paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Aristide attired himself in his best, which
included a white tie and a pair of nearly new brown
boots&mdash;a long task, as he found that his valise
had been spirited away and its contents, including
the white tie of ceremony (he had but one), hidden
in unexpected drawers and wardrobes&mdash;and eventually
went downstairs into the drawing-room. There
he found Miss Christabel and, warming himself on
the hearthrug, a bald-headed, beefy-faced Briton,
with little pig&#8217;s eyes and a hearty manner, attired
in a dinner-suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said this personage, with outstretched
hand, &ldquo;I&#8217;m delighted to have you here.
I&#8217;ve heard so much about you; and my little girl
has been singing your praises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle is too kind,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must take us as you find us,&rdquo; said Mr.
Smith. &ldquo;We&#8217;re just ordinary folk, but I can give
you a good bottle of wine and a good cigar&mdash;it&#8217;s
only in England, you know, that you can get champagne
fit to drink and cigars fit to smoke&mdash;and I
can give you a glimpse of a modest English home.
I believe you haven&#8217;t a word for it in French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ma foi</em>, no,&rdquo; said Aristide, who had once or
twice before heard this lunatic charge brought
against his country. &ldquo;In France the men all live in
caf&eacute;s, the children are all put out to nurse, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the women, saving the respect of mademoiselle&mdash;well,
the less said about them the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;England is the only place, isn&#8217;t it?&rdquo; Mr. Smith
declared, heartily. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t say that Paris hasn&#8217;t
its points. But after all&mdash;the Moulin Rouge and
the Folies Berg&egrave;res and that sort of thing soon
pall, you know&mdash;soon pall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet Paris has its serious side,&rdquo; argued Aristide.
&ldquo;There is always the tomb of Napoleon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa will never take me to Paris,&rdquo; sighed the
girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall go there on your honeymoon,&rdquo; said
Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced. Aristide gave his arm
to Miss Christabel, and proud not only of his partner,
but also of his frock-coat, white tie, and shiny
brown boots, strutted into the dining-room. The
host sat at the end of the beautifully set table, his
daughter on his right, Aristide on his left. The
meal began gaily. The kind Mr. Smith was in the
best of humours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is our dear old friend, Jules Dancourt?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tiens!</em>&rdquo; said Aristide, to himself, &ldquo;we have a
dear friend Jules Dancourt. Wonderfully well,&rdquo; he
replied at a venture, &ldquo;but he suffers terribly at times
from the gout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I, confound it!&rdquo; said Mr. Smith, drinking
sherry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
&ldquo;You and the good Jules were always sympathetic,&rdquo;
said Aristide. &ldquo;Ah! he has spoken to me
so often about you, the tears in his eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men cry, my dear, in France,&rdquo; Mr. Smith explained.
&ldquo;They also kiss each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ah, mais c&#8217;est un beau pays, mademoiselle!</em>&rdquo;
cried Aristide, and he began to talk of France and
to draw pictures of his country which set the girl&#8217;s
eyes dancing. After that he told some of the funny
little stories which had brought him disaster at the
academy. Mr. Smith, with jovial magnanimity,
declared that he was the first Frenchman he had
ever met with a sense of humour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought, Baron,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you lived
all your life shut up in that old ch&acirc;teau of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tiens!</em>&rdquo; thought Aristide. &ldquo;I am still a Baron,
and I have an old ch&acirc;teau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us about the ch&acirc;teau. Has it a fosse and
a drawbridge and a Gothic chapel?&rdquo; asked Miss
Christabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which one do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Aristide,
airily. &ldquo;For I have two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When relating to me this Arabian Nights&#8217; adventure,
he drew my special attention to his astuteness.</p>

<p>His host&#8217;s eye quivered in a wink. &ldquo;The one in
Languedoc,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Languedoc! Almost Pujol&#8217;s own country! With
entire lack of morality, but with picturesque
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
imagination, Aristide plunged into a description of that
non-existent baronial hall. Fosse, drawbridge,
Gothic chapel were but insignificant features. It
had tourelles, emblazoned gateways, bastions, donjons,
barbicans; it had innumerable rooms; in the
<em>salle des chevaliers</em> two hundred men-at-arms had
his ancestors fed at a sitting. There was the room
in which Fran&ccedil;ois Premier had slept, and one in
which Joan of Arc had almost been assassinated.
What the name of himself or of his ancestors was
supposed to be Aristide had no ghost of an idea.
But as he proceeded with the erection of his airy
palace he gradually began to believe in it. He invested
the place with a living atmosphere; conjured
up a staff of family retainers, notably one Marie-Joseph
Loufoque, the wizened old major-domo,
with his long white whiskers and blue and silver
livery. There were also Madeline Mioulles, the
cook, and Bernadet the groom, and La Petite Fripette
the goose girl. Ah! they should see La
Petite Fripette! And he kept dogs and horses and
cows and ducks and hens&mdash;and there was a great
pond whence frogs were drawn to be fed for the
consumption of the household.</p>

<p>Miss Christabel shivered. &ldquo;I should not like
to eat frogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They also eat snails,&rdquo; said her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a snail farm,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;You never
saw such interesting little animals. They are so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
intelligent. If you&#8217;re kind to them they come and
eat out of your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;ah! the pictures,&rdquo; cried aristide, with a wide sweep of his arms</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ve forgotten the pictures,&rdquo; said Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! the pictures,&rdquo; cried Aristide, with a wide
sweep of his arms. &ldquo;Galleries full of them.
Raphael, Michael Angelo, Wiertz, Reynolds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, not in order to produce the effect of
a dramatic aposiopesis, but because he could not
for the moment remember other names of painters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a truly historical ch&acirc;teau,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should love to see it,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>Aristide threw out his arms across the table.
&ldquo;It is yours, mademoiselle, for your honeymoon,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>Dinner came to an end. Miss Christabel left
the gentlemen to their wine, an excellent port whose
English qualities were vaunted by the host. Aristide,
full of food and drink and the mellow glories
of the castle in Languedoc, and smoking an enormous
cigar, felt at ease with all the world. He
knew he should like the kind Mr. Smith, hospitable
though somewhat insular man. He could stay with
him for a week&mdash;or a month&mdash;why not a year?</p>

<p>After coffee and liqueurs had been served Mr.
Smith rose and switched on a powerful electric
light at the end of the large room, showing a picture
on an easel covered by a curtain. He beckoned
to Aristide to join him and, drawing the curtain,
disclosed the picture.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Isn&#8217;t it a stunner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a picture all grey skies and grey water
and grey feathery trees, and a little man in the
foreground wore a red cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful, but indeed it is magnificent!&rdquo;
cried Aristide, always impressionable to things of
beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Genuine Corot, isn&#8217;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>His host poked him in the ribs. &ldquo;I thought I&#8217;d
astonish you. You wouldn&#8217;t believe Gottschalk
could have done it. There it is&mdash;as large as life
and twice as natural. If you or anyone else can
tell it from a genuine Corot I&#8217;ll eat my hat. And
all for eight pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide looked at the beefy face and caught a
look of cunning in the little pig&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now are you satisfied?&rdquo; asked Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than satisfied,&rdquo; said Aristide, though what
he was to be satisfied about passed, for the moment,
his comprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it was a copy of an existing picture, you
know&mdash;one might have understood it&mdash;that, of
course, would be dangerous&mdash;but for a man to go
and get bits out of various Corots and stick them
together like this is miraculous. If it hadn&#8217;t been
for a matter of business principle I&#8217;d have given
the fellow eight guineas instead of pounds&mdash;hanged
if I wouldn&#8217;t! He deserves it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
&ldquo;He does indeed,&rdquo; said Aristide Pujol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now that you&#8217;ve seen it with your own
eyes, what do you think you might ask me for it?
I suggested something between two and three
thousand&mdash;shall we say three? You&#8217;re the owner,
you know.&rdquo; Again the process of rib-digging.
&ldquo;Came out of that historic ch&acirc;teau of yours. My
eye! you&#8217;re a holy terror when you begin to talk.
You almost persuaded me it was real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tiens!</em>&rdquo; said Aristide to himself. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t seem
to have a ch&acirc;teau after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly three thousand,&rdquo; said he, with a grave
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young man thinks he knows a lot, but he
doesn&#8217;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Aristide, with singular laconicism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a blooming thing,&rdquo; continued his host.
&ldquo;But he&#8217;ll pay three thousand, which is the principal,
isn&#8217;t it? He&#8217;s partner in the show, you know,
Ralston, Wiggins, and Wix&#8217;s Brewery&rdquo;&mdash;Aristide
pricked up his ears&mdash;&ldquo;and when his doddering old
father dies he&#8217;ll be Lord Ranelagh and come into
a million of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he seen the picture?&rdquo; asked Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Regards it as a masterpiece. Didn&#8217;t
Brauneberger tell you of the Lancret we planted
on the American?&rdquo; Mr. Smith rubbed hearty hands
at the memory of the iniquity. &ldquo;Same old game.
Always easy. I have nothing to do with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
bargaining or the sale. Just an old friend of the
ruined French nobleman with the historic ch&acirc;teau
and family treasures. He comes along and fixes
the price. I told our friend Harry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; thought Aristide. &ldquo;This is the same
Honourable Harry, M.P., who is engaged to the
ravishing Miss Christabel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; said Mr. Smith, &ldquo;that it might
come to three or four thousand. He jibbed a bit&mdash;so
when I wrote to you I said two or three. But
you might try him with three to begin with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide went back to the table and poured himself
out a fresh glass of his kind host&#8217;s 1865 brandy
and drank it off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exquisite, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve
none finer in my historic ch&acirc;teau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t suppose you have,&rdquo; grinned the host, joining
him. He slapped him on the back. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said he, with a shifty look in his little pig&#8217;s eyes,
&ldquo;let us talk business. What do you think would
be your fair commission? You see, all the trouble
and invention have been mine. What do you say
to four hundred pounds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five,&rdquo; said Aristide, promptly.</p>

<p>A sudden gleam came into the little pig&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Mr. Smith, who had imagined that
the other would demand a thousand and was prepared
to pay eight hundred. &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said he
again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
They shook hands to seal the bargain and drank
another glass of old brandy. At that moment, a
servant, entering, took the host aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please excuse me a moment,&rdquo; said he, and went
with the servant out of the room.</p>

<p>Aristide, left alone, lighted another of his kind
host&#8217;s fat cigars and threw himself into a great
leathern arm-chair by the fire, and surrendered himself
deliciously to the soothing charm of the moment.
Now and then he laughed, finding a certain
comicality in his position. And what a charming
father-in-law, this kind Mr. Smith!</p>

<p>His cheerful reflections were soon disturbed by
the sudden irruption of his host and a grizzled, elderly,
foxy-faced gentleman with a white moustache,
wearing the ribbon of the Legion of Honour
in the buttonhole of his overcoat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you!&rdquo; cried the kind Mr. Smith, striding
up to Aristide, with a very red face. &ldquo;Will you
have the kindness to tell me who the devil you
are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide rose, and, putting his hands behind the
tails of his frock-coat, stood smiling radiantly on
the hearthrug. A wit much less alert than my irresponsible
friend&#8217;s would have instantly appreciated
the fact that the real Simon Pure had arrived
on the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, my dear friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;am the Baron de
Je ne Sais Plus.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
&ldquo;You&#8217;re a confounded impostor,&rdquo; spluttered Mr.
Smith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this gentleman here to whom I have not
had the pleasure of being introduced?&rdquo; asked Aristide,
blandly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am M. Poiron, monsieur, the agent of
Messrs. Brauneberger and Compagnie, art dealers,
of the Rue Notre Dame des Petits Champs of
Paris,&rdquo; said the new-comer, with an air of defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought you were the Baron,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s no blooming Baron at all about it!&rdquo;
screamed Mr. Smith. &ldquo;Are you Poiron, or is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not have a name like Poiron for anything
in the world,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;My name is
Aristide Pujol, soldier of fortune, at your service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How the blazes did you get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your servant asked me if I was a French gentleman
from Manchester. I was. He said that Mr.
Smith had sent his carriage for me. I thought it
hospitable of the kind Mr. Smith. I entered the
carriage&mdash;<em>et voil&agrave;!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then clear out of here this very minute,&rdquo; said
Mr. Smith, reaching forward his hand to the bell-push.</p>

<p>Aristide checked his impulsive action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, dear host,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is raining
dogs and cats outside. I am very comfortable in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
your luxurious home. I am here, and here I stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m shot if you do,&rdquo; said the kind Mr. Smith,
his face growing redder and uglier. &ldquo;Now, will
you go out, or will you be thrown out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide, who had no desire whatever to be
ejected from this snug nest into the welter of the
wet and friendless world, puffed at his cigar, and
looked at his host with the irresistible drollery of
his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget, <em>mon cher ami</em>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that neither
the beautiful Miss Christabel nor her affianced,
the Honourable Harry, M.P., would care to know
that the talented Gottschalk got only eight
pounds, not even guineas, for painting that three-thousand-pound
picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it&#8217;s blackmail, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;and I don&#8217;t blush
at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You infernal little blackguard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to be in congenial company,&rdquo; said Aristide.
&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think our friend M. Poiron has more
scruples than he has right to the ribbon of the Legion
of Honour which he is wearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much will you take to go out? I have a
cheque-book handy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Smith moved a few steps from the hearthrug.
Aristide sat down in the arm-chair. An engaging,
fantastic impudence was one of the charms
of Aristide Pujol.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&#8217;ll take five hundred pounds,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
stay in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay in?&rdquo; Mr. Smith grew apoplectic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;You can&#8217;t do without me.
Your daughter and your servants know me as M. le
Baron&mdash;by the way, what is my name? And where
is my historic ch&acirc;teau in Languedoc?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mireilles,&rdquo; said M. Poiron, who was sitting
grim and taciturn on one of the dining-room chairs.
&ldquo;And the place is the same, near Montpellier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to meet an intelligent man,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to wring your infernal neck,&rdquo; said
the kind Mr. Smith. &ldquo;But, by George, if we do
let you in you&#8217;ll have to sign me a receipt implicating
yourself up to the hilt. I&#8217;m not going to be
put into the cart by you, you can bet your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything you like,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;so long as
we all swing together.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Now, when Aristide Pujol arrived at this point
in his narrative I, his chronicler, who am nothing
if not an eminently respectable, law-abiding Briton,
took him warmly to task for his sheer absence of
moral sense. His eyes, as they sometimes did, assumed
a luminous pathos.</p>

<a name="img116" id="img116"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/img116.jpg" width="491" height="500" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;i&#8217;ll take five hundred pounds,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to stay in&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have you ever faced
the world in a foreign country in December with
no character and fifteen pounds five and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
three-pence in your pocket? Five hundred pounds was
a fortune. It is one now. And to be gained just
by lending oneself to a good farce, which didn&#8217;t
hurt anybody. You and your British morals! Bah!&rdquo;
said he, with a fine flourish.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Aristide, after much parleying, was finally admitted
into the nefarious brotherhood. He was to
retain his rank as the Baron de Mireilles, and play
the part of the pecuniarily inconvenienced nobleman
forced to sell some of his rare collection. Mr.
Smith had heard of the Corot through their dear
old common friend, Jules Dancourt of Rheims, had
mentioned it alluringly to the Honourable Harry,
had arranged for the Baron, who was visiting England,
to bring it over and dispatch it to Mr. Smith&#8217;s
house, and on his return from Manchester to pay
a visit to Mr. Smith, so that he could meet the
Honourable Harry in person. In whatever transaction
ensued Mr. Smith, so far as his prospective
son-in-law was concerned, was to be the purely
disinterested friend. It was Aristide&#8217;s wit which
invented a part for the supplanted M. Poiron. He
should be the eminent Parisian expert who, chancing
to be in London, had been telephoned for by
the kind Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would not be wise for M. Poiron,&rdquo; said Aristide,
chuckling inwardly with puckish glee, &ldquo;to stay
here for the night&mdash;or for two or three days&mdash;or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
a week&mdash;like myself. He must go back to his hotel
when the business is concluded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mais, pardon!</em>&rdquo; cried M. Poiron, who had been
formally invited, and had arrived late solely because
he had missed his train at Manchester, and
come on by the next one. &ldquo;I cannot go out into
the wet, and I have no hotel to go to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide appealed to his host. &ldquo;But he is unreasonable,
<em>cher ami</em>. He must play his <em>r&ocirc;le</em>. M.
Poiron has been telephoned for. He can&#8217;t possibly
stay here. Surely five hundred pounds is worth one
little night of discomfort? And there are a legion
of hotels in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five hundred pounds!&rdquo; exclaimed M. Poiron.
&ldquo;<em>Qu&#8217;est-ce que vous chantez l&agrave;?</em> I want more than
five hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&#8217;re jolly well not going to get it,&rdquo;
cried Mr. Smith, in a rage. &ldquo;And as for you&rdquo;&mdash;he
turned on Aristide&mdash;&ldquo;I&#8217;ll wring your infernal
neck yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, calm yourself!&rdquo; smiled Aristide,
who was enjoying himself hugely.</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and Miss Christabel
appeared. On seeing the decorated stranger
she started with a little &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; of surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Smith&#8217;s angry face wreathed itself in
smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, my darling, is M. Poiron, the eminent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Paris expert, who has been good enough to come
and give us his opinion on the picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>M. Poiron bowed. Aristide advanced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle, your appearance is like a mirage
in a desert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled indulgently and turned to her father.
&ldquo;I&#8217;ve been wondering what had become of you.
Harry has been here for the last half-hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring him in, dear child, bring him in!&rdquo; said
Mr. Smith, with all the heartiness of the fine old
English gentleman. &ldquo;Our good friends are dying
to meet him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl flickered out of the room like a sunbeam
(the phrase is Aristide&#8217;s), and the three precious
rascals put their heads together in a hurried
and earnest colloquy. Presently Miss Christabel
returned, and with her came the Honourable Harry
Ralston, a tall, soldierly fellow, with close-cropped
fair curly hair and a fair moustache, and frank
blue eyes that, even in Parliament, had seen no
harm in his fellow-creatures. Aristide&#8217;s magical
vision caught him wincing ever so little at Mr.
Smith&#8217;s effusive greeting and overdone introductions.
He shook Aristide warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a beauty there, Baron, a perfect
beauty,&rdquo; said he, with the insane ingenuousness of
youth. &ldquo;I wonder how you can manage to part
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ma foi</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide, with his back against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the end of the dining-table and gazing at the masterpiece.
&ldquo;I have so many at the Ch&acirc;teau de Mireilles.
When one begins to collect, you know&mdash;and
when one&#8217;s grandfather and father have had
also the divine mania&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were saying, M. le Baron,&rdquo; said M. Poiron
of Paris, &ldquo;that your respected grandfather bought
this direct from Corot himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A commission,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;My grandfather
was a patron of Corot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like it, dear?&rdquo; asked the Honourable
Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; replied the girl, fervently. &ldquo;It is
beautiful. I feel like Harry about it.&rdquo; She turned
to Aristide. &ldquo;How can you part with it? Were
you really in earnest when you said you would like
me to come and see your collection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;it would be a visit
of enchantment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must take me, then,&rdquo; she whispered to
Harry. &ldquo;The Baron has been telling us about
his lovely old ch&acirc;teau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come, monsieur?&rdquo; asked Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I&#8217;m going to rob you of your picture,&rdquo;
said the young man, with smiling courtesy, &ldquo;the
least I can do is to pay you a visit of apology.
Lovely!&rdquo; said he, going up to the Corot.</p>

<p>Aristide took Miss Christabel, now more bewitching
than ever with the glow of young love in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
her eyes and a flush on her cheek, a step or two
aside and whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is charming, your fianc&eacute;! He almost
deserves his good fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why almost?&rdquo; she laughed, shyly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a man, but a demi-god, that would
deserve you, mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>M. Poiron&#8217;s harsh voice broke out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, it is painted in the beginning of Corot&#8217;s
later manner&mdash;it is 1864. There is the mystery
which, when he was quite an old man, became
a trick. If you were to put it up to auction at
Christie&#8217;s it would fetch, I am sure, five thousand
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s more than I can afford to give,&rdquo; said
the young man, with a laugh. &ldquo;Mr. Smith mentioned
something between three and four thousand
pounds. I don&#8217;t think I can go above
three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to do with it, my dear boy,
nothing whatever,&rdquo; said Mr. Smith, rubbing his
hands. &ldquo;You wanted a Corot. I said I thought I
could put you on to one. It&#8217;s for the Baron here
to mention his price. I retire now and for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Baron?&rdquo; said the young man, cheerfully.
&ldquo;What&#8217;s your idea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide came forward and resumed his place at
the end of the table. The picture was in front of
him beneath the strong electric light; on his left
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
stood Mr. Smith and Poiron, on his right Miss
Christabel and the Honourable Harry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll not take three thousand pounds for it,&rdquo;
said Aristide. &ldquo;A picture like that! Never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you it would be a fair price,&rdquo; said
Poiron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mentioned that figure yourself only just
now,&rdquo; said Mr. Smith, with an ugly glitter in his
little pig&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;that this
picture is my own property.&rdquo; He turned engagingly
to his host. &ldquo;Is it not, <em>cher ami</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is. Who said it wasn&#8217;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, M. Poiron, acknowledge formally that
it is mine,&rdquo; he asked, in French.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sans aucun doute.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Eh bien</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide, throwing open his arms
and gazing round sweetly. &ldquo;I have changed my
mind. I do not sell the picture at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not sell it? What the&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Smith, striving to mellow the gathering
thunder on his brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not sell,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;Listen, my dear
friends!&rdquo; He was in the seventh heaven of happiness&mdash;the
principal man, the star, taking the centre
of the stage. &ldquo;I have an announcement to make
to you. I have fallen desperately in love with
mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a general gasp. Mr. Smith looked at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
him, red-faced and open-mouthed. Miss Christabel
blushed furiously and emitted a sound half between
a laugh and a scream. Harry Ralston&#8217;s eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; said Aristide, disarming him with the
merry splendour of his glance. &ldquo;I do not wish to
take mademoiselle from you. My love is hopeless!
I know it. But it will feed me to my dying day.
In return for the joy of this hopeless passion I will
not sell you the picture&mdash;I give it to you as a wedding
present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood, with the air of a hero, both arms extended
towards the amazed pair of lovers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give it to you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is mine. I have
no wish but for your happiness. In my Ch&acirc;teau
de Mireilles there are a hundred others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is madness!&rdquo; said Mr. Smith, bursting
with suppressed indignation, so that his bald head
grew scarlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow!&rdquo; said Mr. Harry Ralston. &ldquo;It
is unheard-of generosity on your part. But we
can&#8217;t accept it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Aristide, advancing dramatically
to the picture, &ldquo;I take it under my arm, I put it in
a hansom cab, and I go with it back to Languedoc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Smith caught him by the wrist and dragged
him out of the room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
&ldquo;You little brute! Do you want your neck
broken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want the marriage of your daughter
with the rich and Honourable Harry broken?&rdquo;
asked Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, damn! Oh, damn! Oh, damn!&rdquo; cried Mr.
Smith, stamping about helplessly and half weeping.</p>

<p>Aristide entered the dining-room and beamed on
the company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kind Mr. Smith has consented. Mr. Honourable
Harry and Miss Christabel, there is your
Corot. And now, may I be permitted?&rdquo; He rang
the bell. A servant appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some champagne to drink to the health of the
fianc&eacute;s,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Lots of champagne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Smith looked at him almost admiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You <em>have</em> got a
nerve.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;<em>Voil&agrave;!</em>&rdquo; said Aristide, when he had finished the
story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did they accept the Corot?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. It is hanging now in the big house
in Hampshire. I stayed with the kind Mr. Smith
for six weeks,&rdquo; he added, doubling himself up in
his chair and hugging himself with mirth, &ldquo;and
we became very good friends. And I was at the
wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
&ldquo;And what about their honeymoon visit to Languedoc?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;The morning before the
wedding I had a telegram&mdash;it was from my old
father at Aigues-Mortes&mdash;to tell me that the historic
Ch&acirc;teau de Mireilles, with my priceless collection
of pictures, had been burned to the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><strong>THE ADVENTURE OF THE FOUNDLING</strong></p>


<p>There was a time when Aristide Pujol, in
sole charge of an automobile, went gaily
scuttering over the roads of France. I
use the word advisedly. If you had heard the awful
thing as it passed by you would agree that it is the
only word adequate to express its hideous mode of
progression. It was a two-seated, scratched, battered,
ramshackle tin concern of hoary antiquity,
belonging to the childhood of the race. Not only
horses, but other automobiles shied at it. It was
a vehicle of derision. Yet Aristide regarded it
with glowing pride and drove it with such daredevilry
that the parts must have held together only
through sheer breathless wonder. Had it not been
for the car, he told me, he would not have undertaken
the undignified employment in which he was
then engaged&mdash;the mountebank selling of a corn-cure
in the public places of small towns and villages.
It was not a fitting pursuit for a late managing
director of a public company and an ex-Professor
of French in an English Academy for Young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Ladies. He wanted to rise, <em>ma foi</em>, not descend in the
social scale. But when hunger drives&mdash;<em>que voulez-vous</em>?
Besides, there was the automobile. It is
true he had bound himself by his contract to exhibit
a board at the back bearing a flaming picture
of the success of the cure and a legend: &ldquo;<em>Gu&eacute;rissez
vos cors</em>,&rdquo; and to display a banner with the
same device, when weather permitted. But, still,
there was the automobile.</p>

<p>It had been lying for many motor-ages in the
shed of the proprietors of the cure, the Maison
Hi&eacute;ropath of Marseilles, neglected, forlorn, eaten
by rust and worm, when suddenly an idea occurred
to their business imagination. Why should they
not use the automobile to advertise and sell the cure
about the country? The apostle in charge would
pay for his own petrol, take a large percentage on
sales, and the usual traveller&#8217;s commission on orders
that he might place. But where to find an
apostle? Brave and desperate men came in high
hopes, looked at the car, and, shaking their heads
sorrowfully, went away. At last, at the loosest
of ends, came Aristide. The splendour of the idea&mdash;a
poet, in his way, was Aristide, and the Idea
was the thing that always held him captive&mdash;the
splendour of the idea of dashing up to hotels in his
own automobile dazed him. He beheld himself
doing his hundred kilometres an hour and trailing
clouds of glory whithersoever he went. To a child
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
a moth-eaten rocking-horse is a fiery Arab of the
plains; to Aristide Pujol this cheat of the scrap-heap
was a sixty-horse-power thunderer and devourer of
space.</p>

<p>How they managed to botch up her interior so
that she moved unpushed is a mystery which Aristide,
not divining, could not reveal; and when and
where he himself learned to drive a motor-car is
also vague. I believe the knowledge came by nature.
He was a fellow of many weird accomplishments.
He could conjure; he could model birds
and beasts out of breadcrumb; he could play the
drum&mdash;so well that he had a kettle-drum hanging
round his neck during most of his military service;
he could make omelettes and rabbit-hutches; he
could imitate any animal that ever emitted sound&mdash;a
gift that endeared him to children; he could
do almost anything you please&mdash;save stay in one
place and acquire material possessions. The fact
that he had never done a thing before was to him
no proof of his inability to do it. In his superb
self-confidence he would have undertaken to conduct
the orchestra at Covent Garden or navigate
a liner across the Atlantic. Knowing this, I cease
to bother my head about so small a matter as the
way in which he learned to drive a motor-car.</p>

<p>Behold him, then, one raw March morning, scuttering
along the road that leads from Arles to
Salon, in Provence. He wore a goat-skin coat and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
a goat-skin cap drawn down well over his ears.
His handsome bearded face, with its lustrous,
laughing eyes, peeped out curiously human amid the
circumambient shagginess. There was not a turn
visible in the long, straight road that lost itself in
the far distant mist; not a speck on it signifying
cart or creature. Aristide Pujol gave himself up
to the delirium of speed and urged the half-bursting
engine to twenty miles an hour. In spite of the
racing-track surface, the crazy car bumped and
jolted; the sides of the rickety bonnet clashed like
cymbals; every valve wheezed and squealed; every
nut seemed to have got loose and terrifically clattered;
rattling noises, grunting noises, screeching
noises escaped from every part; it creaked and
clanked like an over-insured tramp-steamer in a
typhoon; it lurched as though afflicted with loco-motor
ataxy; and noisome vapours belched forth
from the open exhaust-pipe as though the car were
a Tophet on wheels. But all was music in the ears
of Aristide. The car was going (it did not always
go), the road scudded under him, and the morning
air dashed stingingly into his face. For the moment
he desired nothing more of life.</p>

<p>This road between Arles and Salon runs through
one of the most desolate parts of France: a long,
endless plain, about five miles broad, lying between
two long low ranges of hills. It is strewn like a
monstrous Golgotha, not with skulls, but with huge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
smooth pebbles, as massed together as the shingle
on a beach. Rank grass shoots up in what interstices
it finds; but beyond this nothing grows.
Nothing can grow. On a sunless day under a lowering
sky it is a land accursed. Mile after mile
for nearly twenty miles stretches this stony and
barren waste. No human habitation cheers the sight,
for from such a soil no human hand could wrest
a sustenance. Only the rare traffic going from
Arles to Salon and from Salon to Arles passes along
the road. The cheery passing show of the live
highway is wanting; there are no children, no dogs,
no ducks and hens, no men and women lounging to
their work; no red-trousered soldiers on bicycles,
no blue-bloused, weather-beaten farmers jogging
along in their little carts. As far as the eye can
reach nothing suggestive of man meets the view.
Nothing but the infinite barrenness of the plain, the
ridges on either side, the long, straight, endless
road cleaving through this abomination of desolation.</p>

<p>To walk through it would be a task as depressing
as mortal could execute. But to the speed-drunken
motorist it is a realization of dim and
tremulous visions of Paradise. What need to look
to right or left when you are swallowing up
free mile after mile of dizzying road? Aristide
looked neither to right nor left, and knew this was
heaven at last.</p>

<a name="img132" id="img132"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img132.jpg" width="500" height="444" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">between the folds of the blanket peeped the face<br />
of a sleeping child</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Suddenly, however, he became aware of a small
black spot far ahead in the very middle of the unencumbered
track. As he drew near it looked like
a great stone. He swerved as he passed it, and,
looking, saw that it was a bundle wrapped in a
striped blanket. It seemed so odd that it should
be lying there that, his curiosity being aroused, he
pulled up and walked back a few yards to examine
it. The nearer he approached the less did it resemble
an ordinary bundle. He bent down, and lo!
between the folds of the blanket peeped the face
of a sleeping child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Nom de Dieu!</em>&rdquo; cried Aristide. &ldquo;<em>Nom de Dieu
de nom de Dieu!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ought not to have said it, but his astonishment
was great. He stared at the baby, then up
and down the road, then swept the horizon. Not a
soul was visible. How did the baby get there?
The heavens, according to history, have rained
many things in their time: bread, quails, blood,
frogs, and what not; but there is no mention of
them ever having rained babies. It could not,
therefore, have come from the clouds. It could not
even have fallen from the tail of a cart, for then
it would have been killed, or at least have broken
its bones and generally been rendered a different
baby from the sound, chubby mite sleeping as peacefully
as though the Golgotha of Provence had been
its cradle from birth. It could not have come there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
accidentally. Deliberate hands had laid it down;
in the centre of the road, too. Why not by the
side, where it would have been out of the track of
thundering automobiles? When the murderous intent
became obvious Aristide shivered and felt sick.
He breathed fierce and honest anathema on the
heads of the bowelless fiends who had abandoned
the babe to its doom. Then he stooped and picked
up the bundle tenderly in his arms.</p>

<p>The wee face puckered for a moment and the
wee limbs shot out vigorously; then the dark eyes
opened and stared Aristide solemnly and wonderingly
in the face. So must the infant Remus have
first regarded his she-wolf mother. Having ascertained,
however, that it was not going to be devoured,
it began to cry lustily, showing two little
white specks of teeth in the lower gum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon pauvre petit</em>, you are hungry,&rdquo; said Aristide,
carrying it to the car racked by the clattering
engine. &ldquo;I wonder when you last tasted food? If
I only had a little biscuit and wine to give you;
but, alas! there&#8217;s nothing but petrol and corn-cure,
neither of which, I believe, is good for babies.
Wait, wait, <em>mon ch&egrave;ri</em>, until we get to Salon. There
I promise you proper nourishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He danced the baby up and down in his arms and
made half-remembered and insane noises, which
eventually had the effect of reducing it to its original
calm stare of wonderment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>Voil&agrave;</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide, delighted. &ldquo;Now we can
advance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He deposited it on the vacant seat, clambered
up behind the wheel, and started. But not at the
break-neck speed of twenty miles an hour. He went
slowly and carefully, his heart in his mouth at every
lurch of the afflicted automobile, fearful lest the
child should be precipitated from its slippery resting-place.
But, alas! he did not proceed far. At
the end of a kilometre the engine stopped dead.
He leaped out to see what had happened, and, after
a few perplexed and exhausting moments, remembered.
He had not even petrol to offer to the baby,
having omitted&mdash;most feather-headed of mortals&mdash;to
fill up his tank before starting, and forgotten to
bring a spare tin. There was nothing to be done
save wait patiently until another motorist should
pass by from whom he might purchase the necessary
amount of essence to carry him on to Salon.
Meanwhile the baby would go breakfastless. Aristide
clambered back to his seat, took the child on
his knees, and commiserated it profoundly. Sitting
there on his apparently home-made vehicle, in
the midst of the unearthly silence of the sullen and
barren wilderness, attired in his shaggy goat-skin
cap and coat, he resembled an up-to-date Robinson
Crusoe dandling an infant Friday.</p>

<p>The disposal of the child at Salon would be simple.
After having it fed and tended at an hotel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
he would make his deposition to the police, who
would take it to the Enfants Trouv&eacute;s, the department
of State which provides fathers and mothers
and happy homes for foundlings at a cost to the
country of twenty-five francs a month per foundling.
It is true that the parents so provided think
more of the twenty-five francs than they do of the
foundling. But that was the affair of the State,
not of Aristide Pujol. In the meanwhile he examined
the brat curiously. It was dressed in a coarse
calico jumper, very unclean. The striped blanket
was full of holes and smelled abominably. Some
sort of toilet appeared essential. He got down and
from his valise took what seemed necessary to the
purpose. The jumper and blanket he threw far on
the pebbly waste. The baby, stark naked for a
few moments, crowed and laughed and stretched
like a young animal, revealing itself to be a sturdy
boy about nine months old. When he seemed fit to
be clad Aristide tied him up in the lower part of
a suit of pyjamas, cutting little holes in the sides
for his tiny arms; and, further, with a view to
cheating his hunger, provided him with a shoe-horn.
The defenceless little head he managed to squeeze
into the split mouth of a woollen sock. Aristide regarded
him in triumph. The boy chuckled gleefully.
Then Aristide folded him warm in his travelling-rug
and entered into an animated conversation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Now it happened that, at the most interesting
point of the talk, the baby clutched Aristide&#8217;s finger
in his little brown hand. The tiny fingers
clung strong.</p>

<p>A queer thrill ran through the impressionable
man. The tiny fingers seemed to close round his
heart.... It was a bonny, good-natured,
gurgling scrap&mdash;and the pure eyes looked truthfully
into his soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little wretch!&rdquo; said Aristide, who, peasant&#8217;s
son that he was, knew what he was talking
about. &ldquo;Poor little wretch! If you go into the
Enfants Trouv&eacute;s you&#8217;ll have a devil of a time
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tiny clasp tightened. As if the babe understood,
the chuckle died from his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll be cuffed and kicked and half starved,
while your adopted mother pockets her twenty-five
francs a month, and you&#8217;ll belong to nobody, and
wonder why the deuce you&#8217;re alive, and wish you
were dead; and, if you remember to-day, you&#8217;ll
curse me for not having had the decency to run
over you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clasp relaxed, puckers appeared at the corners
of the dribbling mouth, and a myriad tiny
horizontal lines of care marked the sock-capped
brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little devil!&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;My heart
bleeds for you, especially now that you&#8217;re dressed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
in my sock and pyjama, and are sucking the only
shoe-horn I ever possessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A welcome sound caused Aristide to leap into the
middle of the road. He looked ahead, and there,
in a cloud of dust, a thing like a torpedo came
swooping down. He held up both his arms, the
signal of a motorist in distress. The torpedo approached
with slackened speed, and stopped. It was
an evil-looking, drab, high-powered racer, and two
bears with goggles sat in the midst thereof. The
bear at the wheel raised his cap and asked courteously:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can we do for you, monsieur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the baby broke into heart-rending
cries. Aristide took off his goat-skin cap and,
remaining uncovered, looked at the bear, then at the
baby, then at the bear again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I suppose it&#8217;s useless to
ask you whether you have any milk and a feeding-bottle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mais dites donc!</em>&rdquo; shouted the bear, furiously,
his hand on the brake. &ldquo;Stop an automobile like
this on such a pretext&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide held up a protesting hand, and fixed the
bear with the irresistible roguery of his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, monsieur, I am also out of petrol.
Forgive a father&#8217;s feelings. The baby wants milk
and I want petrol, and I don&#8217;t know whose need
is the more imperative. But if you could sell me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
enough petrol to carry me to Salon I should be
most grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The request for petrol is not to be refused. To
supply it, if possible, is the written law of motordom.
The second bear slid from his seat and extracted
a tin from the recesses of the torpedo, and
stood by while Aristide filled his tank, a process
that necessitated laying the baby on the ground.
He smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem amused,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Parbleu!</em>&rdquo; said the motorist. &ldquo;You have at the
back of your auto a placard telling people to cure
their corns, and in front you carry a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Aristide, &ldquo;is easily understood.
I am the agent of the Maison Hi&eacute;ropath of Marseilles,
and the baby, whom I, its father, am carrying
from a dead mother to an invalid aunt, I am
using as an advertisement. As he luckily has no
corns, I can exhibit his feet as a proof of the efficacy
of the corn-cure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bear laughed and joined his companion, and
the torpedo thundered away. Aristide replaced the
baby, and with a complicated arrangement of string
fastened it securely to the seat. The baby, having
ceased crying, clutched his beard as he bent over,
and &ldquo;goo&#8217;d&rdquo; pleasantly. The tug was at his heart-strings.
How could he give so fascinating, so valiant
a mite over to the Enfants Trouv&eacute;s? Besides,
it belonged to him. Had he not in jest claimed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
paternity? It had given him a new importance. He
could say &ldquo;<em>mon fils</em>,&rdquo; just as he could say (with
equal veracity) &ldquo;<em>mon automobile</em>.&rdquo; A generous
thrill ran through him. He burst into a loud laugh,
clapped his hands, and danced before the delighted
babe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon petit Jean</em>,&rdquo; said he, with humorous tenderness,
&ldquo;for I suppose your name is Jean; I will
rend myself in pieces before I let the Administration
board you out among the wolves. You shall
not go to the Enfants Trouv&eacute;s. I myself will adopt
you, <em>mon petit Jean</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Aristide had no fixed abode whatever, the
address on his visiting-card, &ldquo;213 bis, Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;,
Paris,&rdquo; being that of an old greengrocer
woman of his acquaintance, with whom he lodged
when he visited the metropolis, there was a certain
amount of rashness in the undertaking. But when
was Aristide otherwise than rash? Had prudence
been his guiding principle through life he would not
have been selling corn-cure for the Maison Hi&eacute;ropath,
and consequently would not have discovered
the child at all.</p>

<p>In great delight at this satisfactory settlement
of little Jean&#8217;s destiny, he started the ramshackle
engine and drove triumphantly on his way. Jean,
fatigued by the emotions of the last half-hour,
slumbered peacefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little angel!&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The sun was shining when they arrived at Salon,
the gayest, the most coquettish, the most laughing
little town in Provence. It is a place all trees
and open spaces, and fountains and caf&eacute;s, and
sauntering people. The only thing grim about it
is the solitary machicolated tower in the main street,
the last vestige of ancient ramparts; and even that,
close cuddled on each side by prosperous houses
with shops beneath, looks like an old, old, wrinkled
grandmother smiling amid her daintier grandchildren.
Everyone seemed to be in the open air.
Those who kept shops stood at the doorways. The
prospect augured well for the Maison Hi&eacute;ropath.</p>

<p>Aristide stopped before an hotel, disentangled
Jean, to the mild interest of the passers-by, and,
carrying him in, delivered him into the arms of
the landlady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is my son. I am taking
him from his mother, who is dead, to an aunt
who is an invalid. So he is alone on my hands. He
is very hungry, and I beseech you to feed him at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The motherly woman received the babe instinctively
and cast aside the travelling-rug in which he
was enveloped. Then she nearly dropped him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu! Qu&#8217;est-ce que c&#8217;est que &ccedil;a?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stared in stupefaction at the stocking-cap
and at the long flannel pyjama legs that depended
from the body of the infant, around whose neck
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the waist was tightly drawn. Never since the world
began had babe masqueraded in such attire. Aristide
smiled his most engaging smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son&#8217;s luggage has unfortunately been lost.
His portmanteau, <em>pauvre petit</em>, was so small. A
poor widower, I did what I could. I am but a
mere man, madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; said the woman, with some asperity.</p>

<p>Aristide took a louis from his purse. &ldquo;If you
will purchase him some necessary articles of costume
while I fulfil my duties towards the Maison
Hi&eacute;ropath of Marseilles, which I represent, you
will be doing me a kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlady took the louis in a bewildered fashion.
Allowing for the baby&#8217;s portmanteau to have
gone astray, what, she asked, had become of the
clothes he must have been wearing? Aristide entered
upon a picturesque and realistic explanation.
The landlady was stout, she was stupid, she could
not grasp the fantastic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu!</em>&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;To think that there are
Christians who dress their children like this!&rdquo; She
sighed exhaustively, and, holding the grotesque infant
close to her breast, disappeared indignantly to
administer the very greatly needed motherment.</p>

<a name="img144" id="img144"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">
<img src="images/img144.jpg" width="443" height="500" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">he demonstrated the proper application of the cure</span>
</div>

<p>Aristide breathed a sigh of relief, and after a
well-earned <em>d&eacute;jeuner</em> went forth with the car into
the Place des Arbres and prepared to ply his trade.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
First he unfurled the Hi&eacute;ropath banner, which
floated proudly in the breeze. Then on a folding
table he displayed his collection of ointment-boxes
(together with pills and a toothache-killer which
he sold on his own account) and a wax model of a
human foot on which were grafted putty corns in
every stage of callosity. As soon as half-a-dozen
idlers collected he commenced his harangue. When
their numbers increased he performed prodigies
of chiropody on the putty corns, and demonstrated
the proper application of the cure. He talked incessantly
all the while. He has told me, in the
grand manner, that this phase of his career was
distasteful to him. But I scarcely believe it. If
ever a man loved to talk, it was Aristide Pujol;
and what profession, save that of an advocate, offers
more occasion for wheedling loquacity than
that of a public vendor of quack medicaments? As
a matter of fact, he revelled in it. When he offered
a free box of the cure to the first lady who
confessed the need thereof, and a blushing wench
came forward, the rascal revelled in the opportunity
for badinage which set the good-humoured
crowd in a roar. He loved to exert his half-mesmeric
power. He had not the soul of a mountebank,
for Aristide&#8217;s soul had its high and generous dwelling-place;
but he had the puckish swiftness and
mischief of which the successful mountebank is
made. And he was a success because he treated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
it as an art, thinking nothing during its practice
of the material gain, laughing whole-heartedly,
like his great predecessor Tabarin of imperishable
memory, and satisfying to the full his instinct for
the dramatic. On the other hand, ever since he
started life in the brass-buttoned shell-jacket of a
<em>chasseur</em> in a Marseilles caf&eacute;, and dreamed dreams
of the fairytale lives of the clients who came in
accompanied by beautifully dressed ladies, he had
social ambitions&mdash;and the social status of the mountebank
is, to say the least of it, ambiguous. Ah
me! What would man be without the unattainable?</p>

<p>Aristide pocketed his takings, struck his flag, dismantled
his table, and visited the shops of Salon
in the interests of the Maison Hi&eacute;ropath. The day&#8217;s
work over, he returned to inquire for his supposititious
offspring. The landlady, all smiles, presented
him with a transmogrified Jean, cleansed
and powdered, arrayed in the smug panoply of
bourgeois babyhood. Shoes with a pompon adorned
his feet, and a rakish cap decorated with white
satin ribbons crowned his head. He also wore
an embroidered frock and a pelisse trimmed
with rabbit-fur. Jean grinned and dribbled
self-consciously, and showed his two little teeth
to the proudest father in the world. The
landlady invited the happy parent into her little
dark parlour beyond the office, and there exhibited
a parcel containing garments and implements whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
use was a mystery to Aristide. She also demanded
the greater part of another louis. Aristide began
to learn that fatherhood is expensive. But what
did it matter?</p>

<p>After all, here was a babe equipped to face the
exigencies of a censorious world; in looks and apparel
a credit to any father. As the afternoon was
fine, and as it seemed a pity to waste satin and
rabbit-fur on the murky interior of the hotel, Aristide
borrowed a perambulator from the landlady,
and, joyous as a schoolboy, wheeled the splendid
infant through the sunny avenues of Salon.</p>

<p>That evening a bed was made up for the child
in Aristide&#8217;s room, which, until its master retired
for the night, was haunted by the landlady, the
chambermaids and all the kitchen wenches in the
hotel. Aristide had to turn them out and lock his
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is excellent,&rdquo; said he, apostrophizing the
thoroughly fed, washed, and now sleeping child.
&ldquo;This is superb. As in every hotel there are women,
and as every woman thinks she can be a much better
mother than I, so in every hotel we visit we
shall find a staff of trained and enthusiastic nurses.
Jean, you will live like a little <em>coq en p&acirc;t&eacute;</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night passed amid various excursions on
the part of Aristide and alarms on the part of Jean.
Sometimes the child lay so still that Aristide arose
to see whether he was alive. Sometimes he gave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
such proofs of vitality that Aristide, in terror lest
he should awaken the whole hotel, walked him about
the room chanting lullabies. This was in accordance
with Jean&#8217;s views on luxury. He &ldquo;goo&#8217;d&rdquo;
with joy. When Aristide put him back to bed he
howled. Aristide snatched him up and he &ldquo;goo&#8217;d&rdquo;
again. At last Aristide fed him desperately, dandled
him eventually to sleep, and returned to an
excited pillow. It is a fearsome thing for a man
to be left alone in the dead of night with a young
baby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll get used to it,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>The next morning he purchased a basket, which
he lashed ingeniously on the left-hand seat of the
car, and a cushion, which he fitted into the basket.
The berth prepared, he deposited the sumptuously-apparelled
Jean therein and drove away, amid the
perplexed benisons of the landlady and her satellites.</p>

<p>Thus began the oddest Odyssey on which ever
mortals embarked. The man with the automobile,
the corn-cure, and the baby grew to be legendary in
the villages of Provence. When the days were
fine, Jean in his basket assisted at the dramatic
performance in the market-place. Becoming a magnet
for the women, and being of a good-humoured
and rollicking nature, he helped on the sale of the
cure prodigiously. He earned his keep, as Aristide
declared in exultation. Soon Aristide formed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
a collection of his tricks and doings wherewith he
would entertain the chance acquaintances of his
vagabondage. To a permanent companion he
would have grown insufferable. He invented him
a career from the day of his birth, chronicled the
coming of the first tooth, wept over the demise of
the fictitious mother, and, in his imaginative way,
convinced himself of his fatherhood. And every
day the child crept deeper into the man&#8217;s sunny
heart.</p>

<span class="caption">it is a fearsome thing for a man to be left alone in the

</div>

<p>Together they had many wanderings and many
adventures. The wheezy, crazy mechanism of the
car went to bits in unexpected places. They tobogganed
down hills without a brake at the imminent
peril of their lives. They suffered the indignity
of being towed by wine-wagons. They spent hours
by the wayside while Aristide took her to pieces
and, sometimes with the help of a passing motorist,
put her together again. Sometimes, too, an
inn boasted no landlady, only a dishevelled and
over-driven chambermaid, who refused to wash
Jean. Aristide washed and powdered Jean himself,
the landlord lounging by, pipe in mouth, administering
suggestions. Once Jean grew ill, and
Aristide in terror summoned the doctor, who told
him that he had filled the child up with milk to
bursting-point. Yet, in spite of heterogeneous
nursing and exposure to sun and rain and piercing
mistral, Jean throve exceedingly, and, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Aristide&#8217;s delight, began to cut another tooth. The vain
man began to regard himself as an expert in denticulture.</p>

<p>At the end of a fairly-wide circuit, Aristide, with
empty store-boxes and pleasantly-full pockets, arrived
at the little town of Aix-en-Provence. He
had arrived there not without difficulty. On the
outskirts the car, which had been coaxed reluctantly
along for many weary kilometres, had
groaned, rattled, whirred, given a couple of convulsive
leaps, and stood stock-still. This was one of
her pretty ways. He was used to them, and hitherto
he had been able to wheedle her into resumed
motion. But this time, with all his cunning and
perspiration, he could not induce another throb in
the tired engines. A friendly motorist towed them
to the H&ocirc;tel de Paris in the Cours Mirabeau. Having
arranged for his room and given Jean in charge
of the landlady, he procured some helping hands,
and pushed the car to the nearest garage. There he
gave orders for the car to be put into running condition
for the following morning, and returned to
the hotel.</p>

<p>He found Jean in the vestibule, sprawling sultanesquely
on the landlady&#8217;s lap, the centre of an
admiring circle which consisted of two little girls in
pigtails, an ancient peasant-woman, and two English
ladies of obvious but graceful spinsterhood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is the father,&rdquo; said the landlady.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
He had already explained Jean to the startled
woman&mdash;landladies were always startled at Jean&#8217;s
unconventional advent. &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he had said,
according to rigid formula, &ldquo;this is my son. I am
taking him from his mother, who is dead, to an
aunt who is an invalid, so he is alone on my hands.
I beseech you to let some kind woman attend to
his necessities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no need for further explanation.
Aristide, thus introduced, bowed politely, removed
his Crusoe cap, and smiled luminously at the assembled
women. They resumed their antiphonal
chorus of worship. The brown, merry, friendly
brat had something of Aristide&#8217;s personal charm.
He had a bubble and a &ldquo;goo&rdquo; for everyone. Aristide
looked on in great delight. Jean was a son to
be proud of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ah! qu&#8217;il est fort&mdash;fort comme un Turc.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Regardez ses dents.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The darling thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Il est</em>&mdash;oh, dear!&mdash;<em>il est ravissante!</em>&rdquo;&mdash;with a
disastrous plunge into gender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tiens! il rit. C&#8217;est moi qui le fais rire.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; said the younger Englishwoman to
her sister, &ldquo;of this wee mite travelling about in an
open motor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s having the time of his life. He enjoys
it as much as I do,&rdquo; said Aristide, in his excellent
English.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
The lady started. She was a well-bred, good-humoured
woman in the early thirties, stout, with
reddish hair, and irregular though comely features.
Her sister was thin, faded, sandy, and kind-looking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were French,&rdquo; she said, apologetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; replied Aristide. &ldquo;Proven&ccedil;al of
Provence, M&eacute;ridional of the Midi, Marseillais of
Marseilles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you talk English perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve lived in your beautiful country,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have the bonniest boy,&rdquo; said the elder lady.
&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nine months, three weeks and a day,&rdquo; said
Aristide, promptly.</p>

<p>The younger lady bent over the miraculous infant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I take him? <em>Est-ce que je puis</em>&mdash;oh, dear!&rdquo;
She turned a whimsical face to Aristide.</p>

<p>He translated. The landlady surrendered the
babe. The lady danced him with the spinster&#8217;s
charming awkwardness, yet with instinctive feminine
security, about the hall, while the little girls in
pigtails, daughters of the house, followed like adoratory
angels in an altar-piece, and the old peasant-woman
looked benignly on, a myriad-wrinkled St.
Elizabeth. Aristide had seen Jean dandled by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
dozens of women during their brief comradeship; he
had thought little of it, as it was the natural thing
for women to do; but when this sweet English lady
mothered Jean it seemed to matter a great deal.
She lifted Jean and himself to a higher plane. Her
touch was a consecration.</p>

<p>It was the hour of the day when infants of nine
months should be washed and put to bed. The
landlady, announcing the fact, held out her arms.
Jean clung to his English nurse, who played the
fascinating game of pretending to eat his hand.
The landlady had not that accomplishment. She
was dull and practical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and be washed,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do let me come, too,&rdquo; cried the English
lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Bien volontiers, mademoiselle</em>,&rdquo; said the other.
&ldquo;<em>C&#8217;est par ici.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The English lady held Jean out for the paternal
good-night. Aristide kissed the child in her arms.
The action brought about, for the moment, a curious
and sweet intimacy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister is passionately fond of children,&rdquo; said
the elder lady, in smiling apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too. But Anne&mdash;my sister&mdash;will not let me
have a chance when she is by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After dinner Aristide went up, as usual, to his
room to see that Jean was alive, painless, and asleep.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Finding him awake, he sat by his side and, with
the earnestness of a nursery-maid, patted him off
to slumber. Then he crept out on tiptoe and went
downstairs. Outside the hotel he came upon the
two sisters sitting on a bench and drinking coffee.
The night was fine, the terraces of the neighbouring
caf&eacute;s were filled with people, and all the
life of Aix not at the caf&eacute;s promenaded up and
down the wide and pleasant avenue. The ladies
smiled. How was the boy? He gave the latest
news. Permission to join them at their coffee was
graciously given. A waiter brought a chair and
he sat down. Conversation drifted from the baby
to general topics. The ladies told the simple story
of their tour. They had been to Nice and Marseilles,
and they were going on the next day to
Avignon. They also told their name&mdash;Honeywood.
He gathered that the elder was Janet, the younger
Anne. They lived at Chislehurst when they were
in England, and often came up to London to attend
the Queen&#8217;s Hall concerts and the dramatic performances
at His Majesty&#8217;s Theatre. As guileless,
though as self-reliant, gentlewomen as sequestered
England could produce. Aristide, impressionable
and responsive, fell at once into the key of their
talk. He has told me that their society produced
on him the effect of the cool hands of saints against
his cheek.</p>

<p>At last the conversation inevitably returned to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Jean. The landlady had related the tragic history
of the dead mother and the invalid aunt. They
deplored the orphaned state of the precious babe.
For he was precious, they declared. Miss Anne
had taken him to her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only you had seen him in his bath, Janet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned to Aristide. &ldquo;I&#8217;m afraid,&rdquo; she said,
very softly, hesitating a little&mdash;&ldquo;I&#8217;m afraid this
must be a sad journey for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a wry mouth. The sympathy was so
sincere, so womanly. That which was generous
in him revolted against acceptance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I can play a farce
with landladies&mdash;it happens to be convenient&mdash;in
fact, necessary. But with you&mdash;no. You are different.
Jean is not my child, and who his parents
are I&#8217;ve not the remotest idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not your child?&rdquo; They looked at him incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you&mdash;in confidence,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Jean&#8217;s history was related in all its picturesque
details; the horrors of the life of an <em>enfant trouv&eacute;</em>
luridly depicted. The sisters listened with tears
in their foolish eyes. Behind the tears Anne&#8217;s grew
bright. When he had finished she stretched out her
hand impulsively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I call it splendid of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the hand and, in his graceful French
fashion, touched it with his lips. She flushed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
having expected, in her English way, that he would
grasp it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your commendation, mademoiselle, is sweet to
hear,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he will grow up to be a true comfort to
you, M. Pujol,&rdquo; said Miss Janet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can understand a woman doing what you&#8217;ve
done, but scarcely a man,&rdquo; said Miss Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dear mademoiselle,&rdquo; cried Aristide, with a
large gesture, &ldquo;cannot a man have his heart touched,
his&mdash;his&mdash;<em>ses entrailles, enfin</em>&mdash;stirred by baby fingers?
Why should love of the helpless and the
innocent be denied him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, indeed?&rdquo; said Miss Janet.</p>

<p>Miss Anne said, humbly: &ldquo;I only meant that
your devotion to Jean was all the more beautiful,
M. Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon after this they parted, the night air having
grown chill. Both ladies shook hands with
him warmly.</p>

<p>Anne&#8217;s hand lingered the fraction of a second
longer in his than Janet&#8217;s. She had seen Jean in
his bath.</p>

<p>Aristide wandered down the gay avenue into the
open road and looked at the stars, reading in their
splendour a brilliant destiny for Jean. He felt, in
his sensitive way, that the two sweet-souled Englishwomen
had deepened and sanctified his love for
Jean. When he returned to the hotel he kissed his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
incongruous room-mate with the gentleness of a
woman.</p>

<p>In the morning he went round to the garage. The
foreman mechanician advanced to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to be done, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;nothing to be done&rsquo;?&rdquo;
asked Aristide.</p>

<p>The other shrugged his sturdy shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is worn out. She needs new carburation,
new cylinders, new water-circulation, new lubrication,
new valves, new brakes, new ignition, new
gears, new bolts, new nuts, new everything. In
short, she is not repairable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide listened in incredulous amazement. His
automobile, his wonderful, beautiful, clashing,
dashing automobile unrepairable! It was impossible.
But a quarter of an hour&#8217;s demonstration by
the foreman convinced him. The car was dead.
The engine would never whir again. All the petrol
in the world would not stimulate her into life.
Never again would he sit behind that wheel rejoicing
in the insolence of speed. The car, which,
in spite of her manifold infirmities, he had fondly
imagined to be immortal, had run her last course.
Aristide felt faint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is nothing to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, monsieur. Fifty francs is all that she
is worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;send the basket to
the H&ocirc;tel de Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out of the garage like a man in a dream.
At the door he turned to take a last look at the
Pride of his Life. Her stern was towards him,
and all he saw of her was the ironical legend, &ldquo;Cure
your Corns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the hotel he found the bench outside occupied
chiefly by Jean. One of the little girls in pigtails
was holding him, while Miss Anne administered
the feeding-bottle. Provincial France is the happiest
country in the world&mdash;in that you can live
your intimate, domestic life in public, and nobody
heeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&#8217;ve not come to tell Jean to boot
and saddle,&rdquo; said Miss Anne, a smile on her
roughly-hewn, comely face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Aristide, cheered by the charming
spectacle before him. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t know when we can
get away. My auto has broken down hopelessly.
I ought to go at once to my firm in Marseilles&rdquo;&mdash;he
spoke as if he were a partner in the Maison
Hi&eacute;ropath&mdash;&ldquo;but I don&#8217;t quite know what to do
with Jean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ll look after Jean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said you were leaving for Avignon
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<a name="img162" id="img162"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 463px;">
<img src="images/img162.jpg" width="463" height="600" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">one of the little girls in pigtails was holding him, while
miss anne administered the feeding-bottle</span>
</div>

<p>She laughed, holding the feeding-bottle. &ldquo;The
Palace of the Popes has been standing for six
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
centuries, and it will be still standing to-morrow;
whereas Jean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here Jean, for some reason
known to himself, grinned wet and wide. &ldquo;Isn&#8217;t
he the most fascinating thing of the twentieth century?&rdquo;
she cried, logically inconsequential, like
most of her sex. &ldquo;You go to Marseilles, M.
Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Aristide took the train to Marseilles&mdash;a half-hour&#8217;s
journey&mdash;and in a quarter of the city resembling
a fusion of Jarrow, an unfashionable
part of St. Louis, and a brimstone-manufacturing
suburb of Gehenna, he interviewed the high authorities
of the Maison Hi&eacute;ropath. His cajolery could
lead men into diverse lunacies, but it could not
induce the hard-bitten manufacturer of quack remedies
to provide a brand-new automobile for his
personal convenience. The old auto had broken
down. The manufacturer shrugged his shoulders.
The mystery was that it had lasted as long as it
did. He had expected it to explode the first day.
The idea had originally been that of the junior
partner, a scatter-brained youth whom at times they
humoured. Meanwhile, there being no beplacarded
and beflagged automobile, there could be no advertisement;
therefore they had no further use for
M. Pujol&#8217;s services.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Aristide, when he reached the evil
thoroughfare. &ldquo;It was a degraded occupation, and
I am glad I am out of it. Meanwhile, here is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Marseilles before me, and it will be astonishing
if I do not find some fresh road to fortune before
the day is out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide tramped and tramped all day through
the streets of Marseilles, but the road he sought
he did not find. He returned to Aix in dire perplexity.
He was used to finding himself suddenly
cut off from the means of livelihood. It was his
chronic state of being. His gay resourcefulness
had always carried him through. But then there
had been only himself to think of. Now there
was Jean. For the first time for many years the
dragon-fly&#8217;s wings grew limp. Jean&mdash;what could
he do with Jean?</p>

<p>Jean had already gone to sleep when he arrived.
All day he had been as good as gold, so Miss Anne
declared. For herself, she had spent the happiest
day of her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t wonder at your being devoted to him, M.
Pujol,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has the most loving ways
of any baby I ever met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied Aristide, with an
unaccustomed huskiness in his voice, &ldquo;I am devoted
to him. It may seem odd for a man to be wrapped
up in a baby of nine months old&mdash;but&mdash;it&#8217;s like
that. It&#8217;s true. <em>Je l&#8217;adore de tout mon c&oelig;ur, de
tout mon &ecirc;tre</em>,&rdquo; he cried, in a sudden gust of passion.</p>

<p>Miss Anne smiled kindly, not dreaming of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
perplexity, amused by his Southern warmth. Miss
Janet joined them in the hall. They went in to
dinner, Aristide sitting at the central <em>table d&#8217;h&ocirc;te</em>,
the ladies at a little table by themselves. After
dinner they met again outside the hotel, and drank
coffee and talked the evening away. He was not
as bright a companion as on the night before. His
gaiety was forced. He talked about everything else
in the world but Jean. The temptation to pour his
financial troubles into the sympathetic ears of these
two dear women he resisted. They regarded him
as on a social equality, as a man of means engaged
in some sort of business at Marseilles; they
had invited him to bring Jean to see them at Chislehurst
when he should happen to be in England
again. Pride forbade him to confess himself a
homeless, penniless vagabond. The exquisite
charm of their frank intimacy would be broken.
Besides, what could they do?</p>

<p>They retired early. Aristide again sought the
message of the stars; but the sky was clouded over,
and soon a fine rain began to fall. A bock at a
caf&eacute; brought him neither comfort nor inspiration.
He returned to the hotel, and, eluding a gossip-seeking
landlady, went up to his room.</p>

<p>What could be done? Neither the sleeping babe
nor himself could offer any suggestion. One thing
was grimly inevitable. He and Jean must part.
To carry him about like an infant prince in an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
automobile had, after all, been a simple matter; to
drag him through Heaven knew what hardships in
his makeshift existence was impossible. In his
childlike, impulsive fashion he had not thought of
the future when he adopted Jean. Aristide always
regarded the fortune of the moment as if it would
last forever. Past deceptions never affected his
incurable optimism. Now Jean and he must part.
Aristide felt that the end of the world had come.
His pacing to and fro awoke the child, who demanded,
in his own way, the soothing rocking of
his father&#8217;s arms. There he bubbled and &ldquo;goo&#8217;d&rdquo;
till Aristide&#8217;s heart nearly broke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I do with you, <em>mon petit Jean</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Enfants Trouv&eacute;s, after all? He thought of
it with a shudder.</p>

<p>The child asleep again, he laid it on its bed, and
then sat far into the night thinking barrenly. At
last one of his sudden gleams of inspiration illuminated
his mind. It was the only way. He took out
his watch. It was four o&#8217;clock. What had to be
done must be done swiftly.</p>

<p>In the travelling-basket, which had been sent
from the garage, he placed a pillow, and on to the
pillow he transferred with breathless care the sleeping
Jean, and wrapped him up snug and warm in
bedclothes. Then he folded the tiny day-garments
that lay on a chair, collected the little odds and ends
belonging to the child, took from his valise the rest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of Jean&#8217;s little wardrobe, and laid them at the
foot of the basket. The most miserable man
in France then counted up his money, divided
it into two parts, and wrote a hasty letter,
which, with the bundle of notes, he enclosed
in an envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My little Jean,&rdquo; said he, laying the envelope on
the child&#8217;s breast. &ldquo;Here is a little more than half
my fortune. Half is for yourself and the little
more to pay your wretched father&#8217;s hotel bill.
Good-bye, my little Jean. <em>Je t&#8217;aime bien, tu sais</em>&mdash;and
don&#8217;t reproach me.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>About an hour afterwards Miss Anne awoke and
listened, and in a moment or two Miss Janet awoke
also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Janet, do you hear that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a child crying. It&#8217;s just outside the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds like Jean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, my dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Anne switched on the light and went to see
for herself; and there, in the tiny anteroom that
separated the bedroom from the corridor, she found
the basket&mdash;a new Pharoah&#8217;s daughter before a
new little Moses in the bulrushes. In bewilderment
she brought the ark into the room, and read the
letter addressed to Janet and herself. She burst
into tears. All she said was:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Janet, why couldn&#8217;t he have told us?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
And then she fell to hugging the child to her
bosom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Aristide Pujol, clad in his goat-skin
cap and coat, valise in hand, was plodding through
the rain in search of the elusive phantom, Fortune;
gloriously certain that he had assured Jean&#8217;s future,
yet with such a heartache as he had never had
in his life before.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE ADVENTURE OF THE PIG&#8217;S HEAD</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time Aristide Pujol found himself
standing outside his Paris residence,
No. 213 <em>bis</em>, Rue Saint Honor&eacute;, without a
penny in the world. His last sou had gone to
Madame Bidoux, who kept a small green grocer&#8217;s
shop at No. 213 <em>bis</em> and rented a ridiculously small
back room for a ridiculously small weekly sum to
Aristide whenever he honoured the French capital
with his presence. During his absence she forwarded
him such letters as might arrive for him;
and as this was his only permanent address, and as
he let Madame Bidoux know his whereabouts only
at vague intervals of time, the transaction of business
with Aristide Pujol, &ldquo;Agent, No. 213 <em>bis</em>, Rue
Saint Honor&eacute;, Paris,&rdquo; by correspondence was peculiarly
difficult.</p>

<p>He had made Madame Bidoux&#8217;s acquaintance in
the dim past; and he had made it in his usual direct
and electric manner. Happening to walk down the
Rue Saint Honor&eacute;, he had come upon tragedy.
Madame Bidoux, fat, red of face, tearful of eye
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and strident of voice, held in her arms a little
mongrel dog&mdash;her own precious possession&mdash;which
had just been run over in the street, and the two
of them filled the air with wailings and vociferation.
Aristide uncovered his head, as though he were
about to address a duchess, and smiled at her
engagingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I perceive that your little
dog has a broken leg. As I know all about dogs,
I will, with your permission, set the limb, put it
into splints and guarantee a perfect cure. Needless
to say, I make no charge for my services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snatching the dog from the arms of the fascinated
woman, he darted in his dragon-fly fashion
into the shop, gave a hundred orders to a stupefied
assistant, and&mdash;to cut short a story which Aristide
told me with great wealth of detail&mdash;mended the
precious dog and gained Madame Bidoux&#8217;s eternal
gratitude. For Madame Bidoux the world held no
more remarkable man than Aristide Pujol; and for
Aristide the world held no more devoted friend
than Madame Bidoux. Many a succulent meal, at
the widow&#8217;s expense&mdash;never more enjoyable than
in summer time when she set a little iron table and
a couple of iron chairs on the pavement outside the
shop&mdash;had saved him from starvation; and many a
gewgaw sent from London or Marseilles or other
such remote latitudes filled her heart with pride.
Since my acquaintance with Aristide I myself have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
called on this excellent woman, and I hope I have
won her esteem, though I have never had the
honour of eating pig&#8217;s trotters and chou-cro&ucirc;te with
her on the pavement of the Rue Saint Honor&eacute;.
It is an honour from which, being an unassuming
man, I shrink.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Madame Bidoux has nothing
further to do with the story I am about to relate,
save in one respect:&mdash;</p>

<p>There came a day&mdash;it was a bleak day in November,
when Madame Bidoux&#8217;s temporary financial
difficulties happened to coincide with Aristide&#8217;s.
To him, unsuspicious of coincidence, she confided
her troubles. He emptied the meagre contents of
his purse into her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame Bidoux,&rdquo; said he with a flourish, and
the air of a prince, &ldquo;why didn&#8217;t you tell me before?&rdquo;
and without waiting for her blessing he went out
penniless into the street.</p>

<p>Aristide was never happier than when he had
not a penny piece in the world. He believed, I
fancy, in a dim sort of way, in God and the Virgin
and Holy Water and the Pope; but the faith that
thrilled him to exaltation was his faith in the inevitable
happening of the unexpected. He marched
to meet it with the throbbing pulses of a soldier
rushing to victory or a saint to martyrdom. He
walked up the Rue Saint Honor&eacute;, the Rue de la
Paix, along the Grands Boulevards, smiling on a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
world which teemed with unexpectednesses, until
he reached a caf&eacute; on the Boulevard des Bonnes
Filles de Calvaire. Here he was arrested by Fate,
in the form of a battered man in black, who, springing
from the solitary frostiness of the terrace, threw
his arms about him and kissed him on both cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mais, c&#8217;est toi, Pujol!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>C&#8217;est toi, Roulard!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roulard dragged Aristide to his frosty table and
ordered drinks. Roulard had played the trumpet
in the regimental band in which Aristide had played
the kettle drum. During their military service they
had been inseparables. Since those happy and ear-splitting
days they had not met. They looked at
each other and laughed and thumped each other&#8217;s
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ce vieux Roulard!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ce sacr&eacute; Pujol.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are you doing?&rdquo; asked Aristide, after
the first explosions of astonishment and reminiscence.</p>

<p>A cloud overspread the battered man&#8217;s features.
He had a wife and five children and played in
theatre orchestras. At the present time he was
trombone in the &ldquo;Tourn&eacute;e Gulland,&rdquo; a touring opera
company. It was not gay for a sensitive artist
like him, and the trombone gave one a thirst which
it took half a week&#8217;s salary to satisfy. <em>Mais enfin,
que veux-tu?</em> It was life, a dog&#8217;s life, but life was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
like that. Aristide, he supposed, was making a
fortune. Aristide threw back his head, and laughed
at the exquisite humour of the hypothesis, and gaily
disclosed his Micawberish situation. Roulard sat
for a while thoughtful and silent. Presently a ray
of inspiration dispelled the cloud from the features
of the battered man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tiens, mon vieux</em>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have an idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an idea worthy of Aristide&#8217;s consideration.
The drum of the Tourn&eacute;e Gulland had been dismissed
for drunkenness. The vacancy had not been
filled. Various executants who had drummed on
approval&mdash;this being an out-week of the tour&mdash;had
driven the chef d&#8217;orchestre to the verge of homicidal
mania. Why should not Aristide, past master
in drumming, find an honourable position in the
orchestra of the Tourn&eacute;e Gulland?</p>

<p>Aristide&#8217;s eyes sparkled, his fingers itched for
the drumsticks, he started to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon vieux Roulard!</em>&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you have saved
my life. More than that, you have resuscitated an
artist. Yes, an artist. <em>Sacr&eacute; nom de Dieu!</em> Take
me to this chef d&#8217;orchestre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Roulard, when the hour of rehearsal drew
nigh, conducted Aristide to the murky recesses of
a dirty little theatre in the Batignolles, where Aristide
performed such prodigies of repercussion that
he was forthwith engaged to play the drum, the
kettle-drum, the triangle, the cymbals, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
castagnettes and the tambourine, in the orchestra of the
Tourn&eacute;e Gulland at the dazzling salary of thirty
francs a week.</p>

<p>To tell how Aristide drummed and cymballed
the progress of Les Huguenots, Carmen, La Juive,
La Fille de Madame Angot and L&#8217;Arl&eacute;sienne
through France would mean the rewriting of a
&ldquo;Capitaine Fracasse.&rdquo; To hear the creature talk
about it makes my mouth as a brick kiln and
my flesh as that of a goose. He was the
Adonis, the Apollo, the Don Juan, the Irresistible
of the Tourn&eacute;e. Fled truculent bass and haughty
tenor before him; from diva to moustachioed contralto
in the chorus, all the ladies breathlessly
watched for the fall of his handkerchief; he was
recognized, in fact, as a devil of a fellow. But in
spite of these triumphs, the manipulation of the
drum, kettle-drum, triangle, cymbals, castagnettes
and tambourine, which at first had given him intense
and childish delight, at last became invested
with a mechanical monotony that almost drove him
mad. All day long the thought of the ill-lit corner,
on the extreme right of the orchestra, garnished
with the accursed instruments of noise to which
duty would compel him at eight o&#8217;clock in the evening
hung over him like a hideous doom. Sweet
singers of the female sex were powerless to console.
He passed them by, and haughty tenor and
swaggering basso again took heart of grace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>Mais, mon Dieu, c&#8217;est le m&eacute;tier!</em>&rdquo; expostulated
Roulard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sale m&eacute;tier!</em>&rdquo; cried Aristide, who was as much
fitted for the merciless routine of a theatre orchestra
as a quagga for the shafts of an omnibus.
&ldquo;A beast of a trade! One is no longer a man.
One is just an automatic system of fog-signals!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this depraved state of mind he arrived at
Perpignan, where that befell him which I am about
to relate.</p>

<p>Now, Perpignan is the last town of France on
the Gulf of Lions, a few miles from the Spanish
border. From it you can see the great white
monster of Le Canigou, the pride of the Eastern
Pyrenees, far, far away, blocking up the valley
of the Tet, which flows sluggishly past the little
town. The Quai Sadi-Carnot (is there a provincial
town in France which has not a <em>something</em> Sadi-Carnot
in it?) is on the left bank of the Tet; at
one end is the modern Place Arago, at the other
Le Castillet, a round, castellated red-brick fortress
with curiously long and deep machicolations of
the 14th century with some modern additions of
Louis XI, who also built the adjoining Porte Notre
Dame which gives access to the city. Between the
Castillet and the Place Arago, the Quai Sadi-Carnot
is the site of the Prefecture, the Grand H&ocirc;tel,
various villas and other resorts of the aristocracy.
Any little street off it will lead you into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
seething centre of Perpignan life&mdash;the Place de la Loge,
which is a great block of old buildings surrounded
on its four sides by narrow streets of shops, caf&eacute;s,
private houses, all with balconies and jalousies, all
cramped, crumbling, Spanish, picturesque. The
oldest of this conglomerate block is a corner building,
the Loge de Mer, a thirteenth century palace,
the cloth exchange in the glorious days when
Perpignan was a seaport and its merchant princes
traded with Sultans and Doges and such-like magnificoes
of the Mediterranean. But nowadays its
glory has departed. Below the great gothic windows
spreads the awning of a caf&eacute;, which takes up
all the ground floor. Hugging it tight is the
Mairie, and hugging that, the H&ocirc;tel de Ville.
Hither does every soul in the place, at some hour
or other of the day, inevitably gravitate. Lawyers
and clients, doctors and patients, merchants, lovers,
soldiers, market-women, loafers, horses, dogs,
wagons, all crowd in a noisy medley the narrow
cobble-paved streets around the Loge. Of course
there are other streets, tortuous, odorous and cool,
intersecting the old town, and there are various
open spaces, one of which is the broad market
square on one side flanked by the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Municipal.</p>

<p>From the theatre Aristide Pujol issued one morning
after rehearsal, and, leaving his colleagues, including
the ever-thirsty Roulard, to refresh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
themselves at a humble caf&eacute; hard by, went forth in
search of distraction. He idled about the Place de
la Loge, passed the time of day with a caf&eacute; waiter
until the latter, with a disconcerting &ldquo;<em>Voil&agrave;! Voil&agrave;!</em>&rdquo;
darted off to attend to a customer, and then strolled
through the Porte Notre Dame onto the Quai Sadi-Carnot.
There a familiar sound met his ears&mdash;the
roll of a drum followed by an incantation in a
quavering, high-pitched voice. It was the Town
Crier, with whom, as with a brother artist, he had
picked acquaintance the day before.</p>

<p>They met by the parapet of the Quai, just as
P&egrave;re Bracasse had come to the end of his incantation.
The old man, grizzled, tanned and seamed,
leant weakly against the parapet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How goes it, P&egrave;re Bracasse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, mon bon Monsieur, it goes from bad to
worse,&rdquo; sighed the old man. &ldquo;I am at the end
of my strength. My voice has gone and the accursed
rheumatism in my shoulder gives me
atrocious pain whenever I beat the drum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much more of your round have you to
go?&rdquo; asked Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have only just begun,&rdquo; said P&egrave;re Bracasse.</p>

<p>The Southern sun shone from a cloudless sky; a
light, keen wind blowing from the distant snow-clad
Canigou set the blood tingling. A lunatic idea
flashed through Aristide&#8217;s mind. He whipped the
drum strap over the old man&#8217;s head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
&ldquo;P&egrave;re Bracasse,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are suffering from
rheumatism, bronchitis, fever and corns, and you
must go home to bed. I will finish your round for
you. Listen,&rdquo; and he beat such a tattoo as P&egrave;re
Bracasse had never accomplished in his life.
&ldquo;Where are your words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man, too weary to resist and fascinated
by Aristide&#8217;s laughing eyes, handed him a dirty
piece of paper. Aristide read, played a magnificent
roll and proclaimed in a clarion voice that a gold
bracelet having been lost on Sunday afternoon in
the Avenue des Platanes, whoever would deposit it
at the Mairie would receive a reward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s all?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s all,&rdquo; said P&egrave;re Bracasse. &ldquo;I live in the
Rue Petite-de-la-R&eacute;al, No. 4, and you will
bring me back the drum when you have
finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide darted off like a dragon-fly in the sunshine,
as happy as a child with a new toy. Here he
could play the drum to his heart&#8217;s content with no
score or conductor&#8217;s b&acirc;ton to worry him. He was
also the one and only personage in the drama, concentrating
on himself the attention of the audience.
He pitied poor Roulard, who could never have such
an opportunity with his trombone....</p>

<p>The effect of his drumming before the Caf&eacute; de
la Loge was electric. Shopkeepers ran out of their
shops, housewives craned over their balconies to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
listen to him. By the time he had threaded the busy
strip of the town and emerged on to the Place
Arago he had collected an admiring train of
urchins. On the Place Arago he halted on the
fringe of a crowd surrounding a cheap-jack whose
vociferations he drowned in a roll of thunder. He
drummed and drummed till he became the centre
of the throng. Then he proclaimed the bracelet.
He had not enjoyed himself so much since he left
Paris.</p>

<p>He was striding away, merry-eyed and happy,
followed by his satellites when a prosperous-looking
gentleman with a very red face, a prosperous
roll of fat above the back of his collar, and
the ribbon of the Legion of Honour in his buttonhole,
descending the steps of the great glass-covered
caf&eacute; commanding the Place, hurried up and laid
his finger on his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, my friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what are you
doing there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall hear, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Aristide,
clutching the drumsticks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of Heaven!&rdquo; cried the other hastily
interrupting. &ldquo;Tell me what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am crying the loss of a bracelet, monsieur!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Aristide Pujol, and I play the drum,
kettle-drum, triangle, cymbals, castagnettes and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
tambourine in the orchestra of the Tourn&eacute;e Gulland.
And now, in my turn, may I ask to whom
I have the honour of speaking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Mayor of Perpignan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide raised his hat politely. &ldquo;I hope to have
the pleasure,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of Monsieur le Maire&#8217;s better
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor, attracted by the rascal&#8217;s guileless
mockery, laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will, my friend, if you go on playing that
drum. You are not the Town Crier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide explained. P&egrave;re Bracasse was ill, suffering
from rheumatism, bronchitis, fever and
corns. He was replacing him. The Mayor retorted
that P&egrave;re Bracasse being a municipal functionary
could not transmit his functions except
through the Administration. Monsieur Pujol must
desist from drumming and crying. Aristide bowed
to authority and unstrung his drum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I was enjoying myself so much, Monsieur
le Maire. You have spoiled my day,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>The Mayor laughed again. There was an irresistible
charm and roguishness about the fellow, with
his intelligent oval face, black Vandyke beard and
magically luminous eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have thought you had enough of drums
in your orchestra.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! there I am cramped!&rdquo; cried Aristide. &ldquo;I
have it in horror, in detestation. Here I am free.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
I can give vent to all the aspirations of my
soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor mechanically moved from the spot
where they had been standing. Aristide, embroidering
his theme, mechanically accompanied him;
and, such is democratic France, and also such was
the magnetic, Ancient Mariner-like power of Aristide&mdash;did
not I, myself, on my first meeting with
him at Aigues-Mortes fall helplessly under the spell&mdash;that,
in a few moments, the amateur Town Crier
and the Mayor were walking together, side by side,
along the Quai Sadi-Carnot, engaged in amiable
converse. Aristide told the Mayor the story of his
life&mdash;or such incidents of it as were meet for
Mayoral ears&mdash;and when they parted&mdash;the Mayor
to lunch, Aristide to yield up the interdicted drum
to P&egrave;re Bracasse&mdash;they shook hands warmly and
mutually expressed the wish that they would soon
meet again.</p>

<p>They met again; Aristide saw to that. They met
again that very afternoon in the caf&eacute; on the Place
Arago. When Aristide entered he saw the Mayor
seated at a table in the company of another prosperous,
red-ribboned gentleman. Aristide saluted
politely and addressed the Mayor. The Mayor saluted
and presented him to Monsieur Qu&eacute;rin, the
President of the Syndicat d&#8217;Initiative of the town
of Perpignan. Monsieur Qu&eacute;rin saluted and declared
himself enchanted at the encounter. Aristide
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
stood gossiping until the Mayor invited him
to take a place at the table and consume liquid refreshment.
Aristide glowingly accepted the invitation
and cast a look of triumph around the caf&eacute;.
Not to all mortals is it given to be the boon companion
of a Mayor and a President of the Syndicat
d&#8217;Initiative!</p>

<p>Then ensued a conversation momentous in its
consequences.</p>

<p>The Syndicat d&#8217;Initiative is a semi-official body
existing in most provincial towns in France for the
purpose of organising public festivals for the
citizens and developing the resources and possibilities
of the town for the general amenity of
visitors. Now Perpignan is as picturesque, as sun-smitten
and, in spite of the icy tramontana, even as
joyous a place as tourist could desire; and the Carnival
of Perpignan, as a spontaneous outburst of
gaiety and pageantry, is unique in France. But
Perpignan being at the end of everywhere and leading
nowhere attracts very few visitors. Biarritz
is on the Atlantic coast at the other end of the
Pyrenees; Hy&egrave;res, Cannes and Monte Carlo on the
other side of the Gulf of Lions. No English or
Americans&mdash;the only visitors of any account in the
philosophy of provincial France&mdash;flock to Perpignan.
This was a melancholy fact bewailed by
Monsieur Qu&eacute;rin. The town was perishing from
lack of Anglo-Saxon support. Monsieur Coquereau,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the Mayor, agreed. If the English and Americans
came in their hordes to this paradise of mimosa,
fourteenth century architecture, sunshine and
unique Carnival, the fortunes of all the citizens
would be assured. Perpignan would out-rival Nice.
But what could be done?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Advertise it,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;Flood the English-speaking
world with poetical descriptions of
the place. Build a row of palatial hotels in the
new part of the town. It is not known to the
Anglo-Saxons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you be certain of that?&rdquo; asked Monsieur
Qu&eacute;rin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Parbleu!</em>&rdquo; he cried, with a wide gesture. &ldquo;I
have known the English all my life. I speak their
language as I speak French or my native Proven&ccedil;al.
I have taught in schools in England. I know the
country and the people like my pocket. They have
never heard of Perpignan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His companions acquiesced sadly. Aristide, aglow
with a sudden impudent inspiration, leant across the
marble table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Maire and Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident
du Syndicat d&#8217;Initiative, I am sick to death of playing
the drum, the kettle-drum, the triangle, the
cymbals, the castagnettes and the tambourine in the
Tourn&eacute;e Gulland. I was born to higher things.
Entrust to me&rdquo;&mdash;he converged the finger-tips of
both hands to his bosom&mdash;&ldquo;to me, Aristide Pujol,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the organisation of Perpignan-Ville de Plaisir, and
you will not regret it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor and the President laughed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>But my astonishing friend prevailed&mdash;not indeed
to the extent of being appointed a Petronius, <em>arbiter
&eacute;legantiarum</em>, of the town of Perpignan; but to
the extent of being employed, I fear in a subordinate
capacity, by the Mayor and the Syndicat
in the work of propagandism. The Tourn&eacute;e Gulland
found another drum and went its tuneful but
weary way; and Aristide remained gloriously behind
and rubbed his hands with glee. At last he
had found permanence in a life where heretofore
had been naught but transience. At last he had
found a sphere worthy of his genius. He began
to nourish insensate ambitions. He would be the
Great Benefactor of Perpignan. All Roussillon
should bless his name. Already he saw his statue
on the Quai Sadi-Carnot.</p>

<p>His rise in the social scale of the town was
meteoric, chiefly owing to the goodwill of Madame
Coquereau, the widowed mother of the Mayor. She
was a hard-featured old lady, with a face that might
have been made of corrugated iron painted yellow
and with the eyes of an old hawk. She dressed
always in black, was very devout and rich and
narrow and iron-willed. Aristide was presented
to her one Sunday afternoon at the Caf&eacute; on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Place Arago&mdash;where on Sunday afternoons all the
fashion of Perpignan assembles&mdash;and&mdash;need I say
it?&mdash;she fell at once a helpless victim to his fascination.
Accompanying her grandmother was
Mademoiselle St&eacute;phanie Coquereau, the Mayor&#8217;s
niece (a wealthy orphan, as Aristide soon learned),
nineteen, pretty, demure, perfectly brought up, who
said &ldquo;<em>Oui, Monsieur</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Non, Monsieur</em>&rdquo; with
that quintessence of modest grace which only a provincial
French Convent can cultivate.</p>

<p>Aristide&#8217;s heart left his body and rolled at the
feet of Mademoiselle St&eacute;phanie. It was a way with
Aristide&#8217;s heart. It was always doing that. He
was of Provence and not of Peckham Rye or Hoboken,
and he could not help it.</p>

<p>Aristide called on Madame Coquereau, who entertained
him with sweet Frontignan wine, dry
sponge cakes and conversation. After a while he
was invited to dinner. In a short space of time
he became the intimate friend of the house, and
played piquet with Madame Coquereau, and grew
familiar with the family secrets. First he learned
that Mademoiselle St&eacute;phanie would go to a husband
with two hundred and fifty thousand francs. Aristide&#8217;s
heart panted at the feet of Mademoiselle St&eacute;phanie.
Further he gathered that, though Monsieur
Coquereau was a personage of great dignity and
importance in civic affairs, he was as but a little
child in his own house. Madame Coquereau held
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the money-bags. Her son had but little personal
fortune. He had reached the age of forty-five without
being able to marry. Marriage unauthorized
by Madame Coquereau meant immediate poverty
and the testamentary assignment of Madame Coquereau&#8217;s
fortune to various religious establishments.
None of the objects of Monsieur Coquereau&#8217;s
matrimonial desire had pleased Madame
Coquereau, and none of Madame Coquereau&#8217;s
blushing candidates had caused a pulse in Monsieur
Coquereau&#8217;s being to beat the faster. The Mayor
held his mother in professed adoration and holy
terror. She held him in abject subjection. Aristide
became the confidant, in turn, of Madame&#8217;s
sour philosophy of life and of Monsieur&#8217;s impotence
and despair. As for Mademoiselle St&eacute;phanie,
she kept on saying &ldquo;<em>Oui, Monsieur</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Non,
Monsieur</em>,&rdquo; in a crescendo of maddening demureness.</p>

<p>So passed the halcyon hours. During the day
time Aristide in a corner of the Mayor&#8217;s office,
drew up flamboyant circulars in English which
would have put a pushing Land and Estate Agent
in the New Jerusalem to the blush, and in the evening
played piquet with Madame Coquereau, while
Mademoiselle St&eacute;phanie, model of modest piety,
worked pure but nameless birds and flowers on her
embroidery frame. Monsieur le Maire, of course,
played his game of manilla at the caf&eacute;, after dinner,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and generally came home just before Aristide
took his leave. If it had not been for the presence
of Mademoiselle St&eacute;phanie, it would not have
been gay for Aristide. But love gilded the moments.</p>

<p>On the first evening of the Carnival, which lasts
nearly a fortnight in Perpignan, Aristide, in spite
of a sweeter &ldquo;<em>Oui, Monsieur</em>&rdquo; than ever from
Mademoiselle St&eacute;phanie, made an excuse to slip
away rather earlier than usual, and, front door having
closed behind him, crossed the strip of gravel
with a quick step and flung out of the iron gates.
Now the house had an isolated position in the new
quarter of the town. It was perky and modern and
defaced by all sorts of oriel windows and tourelles
and pinnacles which gave it a top-heavy appearance,
and it was surrounded by a low brick wall.
Aristide, on emerging through the iron gates, heard
the sound of scurrying footsteps on the side of the
wall nearest to the town, and reached the corner,
just in time to see a masquer, attired in a Pierrot
costume and wearing what seemed to be a pig&#8217;s
head, disappear round the further angle. Paying no
heed to this phenomenon, Aristide lit a cigarette
and walked, in anticipation of enjoyment, to the
great Avenue des Plantanes where the revelry of
the Carnival was being held. Aristide was young,
he loved flirtation, and flirtation flourished in the
Avenue des Plantanes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
The next morning the Mayor entered his office
with a very grave face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what has happened? My house
was broken into last night. The safe in my study
was forced open, and three thousand francs and
some valuable jewelry were stolen. <em>Quel malheur!</em>&rdquo;
he cried, throwing himself into a chair, and
wiping his forehead. &ldquo;It is not I who can afford
to lose three thousand francs at once. If they had
robbed <em>maman</em> it would have been a different matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide expressed his sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom do you suspect?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A robber, <em>parbleu!</em>&rdquo; said the Mayor. &ldquo;The
police are even now making their investigations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door opened and a plain clothes detective
entered the office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Maire,&rdquo; said he, with an air of triumph,
&ldquo;I know a burglar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both men leapt to their feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>A la bonne heure!</em>&rdquo; cried the Mayor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrest him at once,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, Monsieur,&rdquo; said the detective, &ldquo;that I
cannot do. I have called on him this morning and
his wife tells me that he left for the North yesterday
afternoon. But it is Jos&eacute; Pu&eacute;gas that did it.
I know his ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>Tiens!</em>&rdquo; said the Mayor, reflectively. &ldquo;I know
him also, an evil fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why are you not looking for him?&rdquo; exclaimed
Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrangements have been made,&rdquo; replied the detective
coldly.</p>

<p>Aristide suddenly bethought him of the furtive
masquer of the night before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can put you on his track,&rdquo; said he, and related
what he knew.</p>

<p>The Mayor looked dubious. &ldquo;It wasn&#8217;t he,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute; Pu&eacute;gas, Monsieur, would not commit a
burglary in a pig&#8217;s head,&rdquo; said the policeman, with
the cutting contempt of the expert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a vow, I suppose,&rdquo; said Aristide, stung
to irony. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve always heard he was a religious
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The detective did not condescend to reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Maire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I should like to
examine the premises, and beg that you will have
the kindness to accompany me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the permission of Monsieur le Maire,&rdquo;
said Aristide. &ldquo;I too will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the Mayor. &ldquo;The more intelligences
concentrated on the affair the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not of that opinion,&rdquo; said the detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the opinion of Monsieur le Maire,&rdquo; said
Aristide rebukingly, &ldquo;and that is enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
When they reached the house&mdash;distances are
short in Perpignan&mdash;they found policemen busily
engaged with tape measures around the premises.
Old Madame Coquereau in a clean white linen
dressing jacket, bare-headed, defying the keen air,
stood grim and eager in the midst of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Monsieur Pujol, what do you
think of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A veritable catastrophe,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>She shrugged her iron shoulders. &ldquo;I tell him it
serves him right,&rdquo; she said, cuttingly. &ldquo;A sensible
person keeps his money under his mattress and
not in a tin machine by a window which anyone
can get at. I wonder we&#8217;ve not been murdered in
our beds before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ah, Maman!</em>&rdquo; expostulated the Mayor of Perpignan.</p>

<p>But she turned her back on him and worried the
policemen. They, having probed, and measured,
and consulted with the detective, came to an exact
conclusion. The thief had climbed over the back
wall&mdash;there were his footsteps. He had entered
by the kitchen door&mdash;there were the marks of infraction.
He had broken open the safe&mdash;there was
the helpless condition of the lock. No one in Perpignan,
but Jos&eacute; Pu&eacute;gas, with his bad, socialistic,
Barcelona blood, could have done it. These brilliant
results were arrived at after much clamour
and argument and imposing <em>proc&egrave;s verbal</em>. Aristide
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
felt strangely depressed. He had narrated his
story of the pig-headed masquer to unresponsive
ears. Here was a melodramatic scene in which he
not only was not playing a leading part, but did not
even carry a banner. To be less than a super in
life&#8217;s pageant was abhorrent to the nature of Aristide
Pujol.</p>

<p>Moodily he wandered away from the little crowd.
He hated the police and their airs of gods for whom
exists no mystery. He did not believe in the
kitchen-door theory. Why should not the thief
have simply entered by the window of the study,
which like the kitchen, was on the ground floor?
He went round the house and examined the window
by himself. No; there were no traces of burglary.
The fastenings of the outside shutters and
the high window were intact. The police were
right.</p>

<p>Suddenly his quick eye lit on something in the
gravel path and his heart gave a great leap. It was
a little round pink disc of confetti.</p>

<p>Aristide picked it up and began to dance and
shake his fist at the invisible police.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;now we shall see who is right
and who is wrong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began to search and soon found another bit
of confetti. A little further along he discovered
a third and a fourth. By using his walking stick
he discovered that they formed a trail to a point in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the wall. He examined the wall. There, if his eyes
did not deceive him, were evidences of mortar dislodged
by nefarious toes. And there, <em>mirabile visu!</em>
at the very bottom of the wall lay a little woollen
pompon or tassel, just the kind of pompon that
gives a finish to a pierrot&#8217;s shoes. Evidently the
scoundrel had scraped it off against the bricks
while clambering over.</p>

<p>The pig-headed masquer stood confessed.</p>

<p>A less imaginative man than Aristide would
have immediately acquainted the police with his
discovery. But Aristide had been insulted. A dull,
mechanical bureaucrat who tried to discover crime
with a tape-measure had dared to talk contemptuously
of his intelligence! On his wooden head
should be poured the vials of his contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tron de l&#8217;air!</em>&rdquo; cried Aristide&mdash;a Proven&ccedil;al
oath which he only used on sublime occasions&mdash;&ldquo;It
is I who will discover the thief and make the
whole lot of you the laughing-stock of Perpignan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So did my versatile friend, joyously confident in
his powers, start on his glorious career as a private
detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame Coquereau,&rdquo; said he, that evening,
while she was dealing a hand at piquet, &ldquo;what
would you say if I solved this mystery and brought
the scoundrel to justice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To say that you would have more sense than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the police, would be a poor compliment,&rdquo; said the
old lady.</p>

<p>St&eacute;phanie raised cloistral eyes from her embroidery
frame. She sat in a distant corner
of the formal room discreetly lit by a shaded
lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a clue, Monsieur?&rdquo; she asked with
adorable timidity.</p>

<p>Aristide tapped his forehead with his forefinger.
&ldquo;All is there, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They exchanged a glance&mdash;the first they had exchanged&mdash;while
Madame Coquereau was frowning
at her cards; and Aristide interpreted the glance
as the promise of supreme reward for great deeds
accomplished.</p>

<p>The mayor returned early from the caf&eacute;, a dejected
man. The loss of his hundred and twenty
pounds weighed heavily on his mind. He kissed
his mother sorrowfully on the cheek, his niece on
the brow, held out a drooping hand to Aristide,
and, subsiding into a stiff imitation Louis XVI
chair, rested his elbows on its unconsoling arms and
hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor uncle! You suffer so much?&rdquo; breathed
St&eacute;phanie, in divine compassion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Saint!&rdquo; murmured Aristide devoutly, as
he declared four aces and three queens.</p>

<p>The Mayor moved his head sympathetically. He
was suffering from the sharpest pain in his pocket
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
he had felt for many a day. Madame Coquereau&#8217;s
attention wandered from the cards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Dis donc</em>, Fernand,&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;Why
are you not wearing your ring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Maman</em>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is stolen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your beautiful ring?&rdquo; cried Aristide.</p>

<p>The Mayor&#8217;s ring, which he usually wore, was
a remarkable personal adornment. It consisted in
a couple of snakes in old gold clenching an enormous
topaz between their heads. Only a Mayor
could have worn it with decency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not tell me, Fernand,&rdquo; rasped the old
lady. &ldquo;You did not mention it to me as being one
of the stolen objects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayor rose wearily. &ldquo;It was to avoid giving
you pain, <em>maman</em>. I know what a value you
set upon the ring of my good Aunt Philom&egrave;ne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now it is lost,&rdquo; said Madame Coquereau,
throwing down her cards. &ldquo;A ring that belonged
to a saint. Yes, Monsieur Pujol, a saint, though
she was my sister. A ring that had been blessed
by His Holiness the Pope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, <em>maman</em>,&rdquo; expostulated the Mayor, &ldquo;that
was an imagination of Aunt Philom&egrave;ne. Just because
she went to Rome and had an audience like
anyone else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, impious atheist that you are!&rdquo; cried the
old lady. &ldquo;I tell you it was blessed by His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Holiness&mdash;and when I tell you a thing it is true. That
is the son of to-day. He will call his mother a
liar as soon as look at her. It was a ring beyond
price. A ring such as there are few in the world.
And instead of taking care of this precious heirloom,
he goes and locks it away in a safe. Ah!
you fill me with shame. Monsieur Pujol, I am
sorry I can play no more, I must retire. St&eacute;phanie,
will you accompany me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And gathering up St&eacute;phanie like a bunch of
snowdrops, the yellow, galvanized iron old lady
swept out of the room.</p>

<p>The Mayor looked at Aristide and moved his
arms dejectedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such are women,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own mother nearly broke her heart because
I would not become a priest,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I were a Turk,&rdquo; said the Mayor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>He took pouch and papers and rolled a cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is a man living who can say he has
not felt like that at least once in his life he ought
to be exhibited at a fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How well you understand me, my good Pujol,&rdquo;
said Monsieur Coquereau.</p>

<p>The next few days passed busily for Aristide.
He devoted every spare hour to his new task. He
scrutinized every inch of ground between the study
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
window and the wall; he drew radiating lines from
the point of the wall whence the miscreant had
started homeward and succeeded in finding more
confetti. He cross-examined every purveyor of
pierrot shoes and pig&#8217;s heads in Perpignan. His
researches soon came to the ears of the police, still
tracing the mysterious Jos&eacute; Pu&eacute;gas. A certain
good-humoured brigadier whose Catalan French
Aristide found difficult to understand, but with
whom he had formed a derisory kind of friendship,
urged him to desist from the hopeless task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Jamais de la vie!</em>&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;The honour of
Aristide Pujol is at stake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thing became an obsession. Not only his
honour but his future was at stake. If he discovered
the thief, he would be the most talked of person
in Perpignan. He would know how to improve
his position. He would rise to dizzy heights. Perpignan-Ville
de Plaisir would acclaim him as its
saviour. The Government would decorate him.
And finally, both the Mayor and Madame Coquereau
would place the blushing and adorable Mademoiselle
St&eacute;phanie in his arms and her two hundred
and fifty thousand francs dowry in his pocket.
Never before had so dazzling a prize shimmered
before him in the near distance.</p>

<p>On the last Saturday night of the Carnival, there
was a special <em>corso</em> for the populace in the Avenue
des Plantanes, the long splendid Avenue of plane
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
trees just outside the Porte Notre Dame, which is
the special glory of Perpignan. The masquers
danced to three or four bands. They threw confetti
and <em>serpentins</em>. They rode hobby-horses and
beat each other with bladders. They joined in
bands of youths and maidens and whirled down
the Avenue in Bacchic madness. It was a <em>corso
blanc</em>, and everyone wore white&mdash;chiefly modifications
of Pierrot costume&mdash;and everyone was
masked. Chinese lanterns hung from the trees and
in festoons around the bandstands and darted about
in the hands of the revellers. Above, great standard
electric lamps shed their white glare upon the
eddying throng casting a myriad of grotesque
shadows. Shouts and laughter and music filled
the air.</p>

<p>Aristide in a hideous red mask and with a bag
of confetti under his arm, plunged with enthusiasm
into the revelry. To enjoy yourself you only had
to throw your arm round a girl&#8217;s waist and swing
her off wildly to the beat of the music. If you
wanted to let her go you did so; if not, you talked
in the squeaky voice that is the recognized etiquette
of the carnival. On the other hand any
girl could catch you in her grip and sweep you
along with her. Your mad career generally ended
in a crowd and a free fight of confetti. There
was one fair masquer, however, to whom Aristide
became peculiarly attracted. Her movements were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
free, her figure dainty and her repartee, below her
mask, more than usually piquant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This hurly-burly,&rdquo; said he, drawing her into a
quiet eddy of the stream, &ldquo;is no place for the communion
of two twin souls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Beau masque</em>,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I perceive that you
are a man of much sensibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we find a spot where we can mingle the
overflow of our exquisite natures?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Allons! Hop!</em>&rdquo; cried he, and seizing her round
the waist danced through the masquers to the very
far end of the Avenue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a sequestered spot round here,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>They turned. The sequestered spot, a seat beneath
a plane tree, with a lonesome arc-lamp shining
full upon it, was occupied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a pity!&rdquo; said the fair unknown.</p>

<p>But Aristide said nothing. He stared. On the
seat reposed an amorous couple. The lady wore a
white domino and a black mask. The cavalier,
whose arm was around the lady&#8217;s waist, wore a
pig&#8217;s head, and a clown or Pierrot&#8217;s dress.</p>

<p>Aristide&#8217;s eyes fell upon the shoes. On one of
them the pompon was missing.</p>

<p>The lady&#8217;s left hand tenderly patted the cardboard
snout of her lover. The fierce light of the
arc lamp caught the hand and revealed, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
fourth finger, a topaz ring, the topaz held in its
place by two snakes&#8217; heads.</p>

<p>Aristide stared for two seconds; it seemed to
him two centuries. Then he turned simply, caught
his partner again, and with a &ldquo;<em>Allons, Hop!</em>&rdquo; raced
back to the middle of the throng. There, in the
crush, he unceremoniously lost her, and sped like
a maniac to the entrance gates. His friend the
brigadier happened to be on duty. He unmasked
himself, dragged the police agent aside, and
breathless, half-hysterical, acquainted him with the
astounding discovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was right, <em>mon vieux!</em> There at the end of
the Avenue you will find them. The pig-headed
prowler I saw, with <em>my</em> pompon missing from his
shoe, and his <em>bonne amie</em> wearing the stolen ring.
Ah! you police people with your tape-measures and
your Jos&eacute; Pu&eacute;gas! It is I, Aristide Pujol, who
have to come to Perpignan to teach you your business!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; asked the brigadier
stolidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; cried Aristide. &ldquo;Do you think I want
you to kiss them and cover them with roses? What
do you generally do with thieves in Perpignan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrest them,&rdquo; said the brigadier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Eh bien!</em>&rdquo; said Aristide. Then he paused&mdash;possibly
the drama of the situation striking him.
&ldquo;No, wait. Go and find them. Don&#8217;t take your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
eyes off them. I will run and fetch Monsieur le
Maire and he will identify his property&mdash;<em>et puis
nous aurons la sc&egrave;ne &agrave; faire</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stout brigadier grunted an assent and rolled
monumentally down the Avenue. Aristide, his
pulses throbbing, his heart exulting, ran to the
Mayor&#8217;s house. He was rather a panting triumph
than a man. He had beaten the police of
Perpignan. He had discovered the thief. He was
the hero of the town. Soon would the wedding
bells be playing.... He envied the marble
of the future statue. He would like to be on the
pedestal himself.</p>

<p>He dashed past the maid-servant who opened the
door and burst into the prim salon. Madame Coquereau
was alone, just preparing to retire for the
night. Mademoiselle St&eacute;phanie had already gone
to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu</em>, what is all this?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; shouted he, &ldquo;glorious news. I have
found the thief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told his tale. Where was Monsieur le Maire?</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has not yet come back from the caf&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll go and find him,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And waste time? Bah!&rdquo; said the iron-faced
old lady, catching up a black silk shawl. &ldquo;I will
come with you and identify the ring of my sainted
sister Philom&egrave;ne. Who should know it better than
I?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
&ldquo;As you like, Madame,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>Two minutes found them on their journey. Madame
Coquereau, in spite of her sixty-five years
trudged along with springing step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&#8217;t make metal like me, nowadays,&rdquo;
she said scornfully.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the gate of the Avenue,
the police on guard saluted. The mother
of Monsieur le Maire was a power in Perpignan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Aristide, in lordly fashion,
to a policeman, &ldquo;will you have the goodness to
make a passage through the crowd for Madame
Coquereau, and then help the Brigadier P&eacute;sac to
arrest the burglar who broke into the house of
Monsieur le Maire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man obeyed, went ahead clearing the path
with the unceremoniousness of the law, and Aristide
giving his arm to Madame Coquereau followed
gloriously. As the impressive progress continued
the revellers ceased their revels and followed
in the wake of Aristide. At the end of the
Avenue Brigadier P&eacute;sac was on guard. He approached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are still there,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>The two police-officers, Aristide and Madame
Coquereau turned the corner. At the sight of the
police the guilty couple started to their feet. Madame
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Coquereau pounced like a hawk on the
masked lady&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I identify it,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Brigadier, give these
people in charge for theft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The white masked crowd surged around the
group, in the midst of which stood Aristide transfigured.
It was his supreme moment. He flourished
in one hand his red mask and in the other
a pompon which he had extracted from his
pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This I found,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;beneath the wall of
Monsieur le Maire&#8217;s garden. Behold the shoe of
the accused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd murmured their applause and admiration.
Neither of the prisoners stirred. The pig&#8217;s
head grinned at the world with its inane, painted
leer. A rumbling voice beneath it said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will go quietly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Attention s&#8217;il vous pla&icirc;t</em>,&rdquo; said the policemen,
and each holding a prisoner by the arm they made
a way through the crowd. Madame Coquereau
and Aristide followed close behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; cried Aristide to the
brigadier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s Pu&eacute;gas, all the same,&rdquo; said the brigadier,
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet you it&#8217;s not,&rdquo; said Aristide, and striding
swiftly to the back of the male prisoner whipped
off the pig&#8217;s head, and revealed to the petrified
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
throng the familiar features of the Mayor of Perpignan.</p>

<p>Aristide regarded him for two or three seconds
open-mouthed, and then fell back into the arms of
the Brigadier P&eacute;sac screaming with convulsive
laughter. The crowd caught the infection of merriment.
Shrieks filled the air. The vast mass of
masqueraders held their sides, swayed helplessly,
rolled in heaps, men and women, tearing each
other&#8217;s garments as they fell.</p>

<p>Aristide, deposited on the ground by the Brigadier
P&eacute;sac laughed and laughed. When he recovered
some consciousness of surroundings, he found
the Mayor bending over him and using language
that would have made Tophet put its fingers in
its ears. He rose. Madame Coquereau shook her
thin fists in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imbecile! Triple fool!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>Aristide turned tail and fled. There was nothing
else to do.</p>

<p>And that was the end of his career at Perpignan.
Vanished were the dreams of civic eminence;
melted into thin air the statue on the Quai Sadi-Carnot;
faded, too, the vision of the modest St&eacute;phanie
crowned with orange-blossom; gone forever
the two hundred and fifty thousand francs. Never
since Alnaschar kicked over his basket of crockery
was there such a hideous welter of shattered hopes.</p>

<p>If the Mayor had been allowed to go disguised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
to the Police Station, he could have disclosed his
identity and that of the lady in private to awe-stricken
functionaries. He might have forgiven
Aristide. But Aristide had exposed him to the derision
of the whole of Roussillon and the never ending
wrath of Madame Coquereau. Ruefully Aristide
asked himself the question: why had the Mayor not
taken him into the confidence of his masquerading
escapade? Why had he not told him of the pretty
widow, whom, unknown to his mother, he was
courting? Why had he permitted her to wear the
ring which he had given her so as to spite his
sainted Aunt Philom&egrave;ne? And why had he gone
on wearing the pig&#8217;s head after Aristide had told
him of his suspicions? Ruefully Aristide found
no answers save in the general chuckle-headedness
of mankind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&#8217;t been such a good farce I should
have wept like a cow,&rdquo; said Aristide, after relating
this story. &ldquo;But every time I wanted to cry,
I laughed. <em>Nom de Dieu!</em> You should have seen
his face! And the face of Madame Coquereau!
She opened her mouth wide showing ten yellow
teeth and squealed like a rabbit! Oh, it was a
good farce! He was very cross with me,&rdquo; he
added after a smiling pause, &ldquo;and when I got back
to Paris I tried to pacify him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sent him my photograph,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE ADVENTURE OF FLEURETTE</strong></p>


<p>One day, when Aristide was discoursing on
the inexhaustible subject of woman, I
pulled him up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you seem to have
fallen in love with every woman you have ever met.
But for how many of them have you really cared?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu!</em> For all of them!&rdquo; he cried, springing
from his chair and making a wind-mill of himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;all that amorousness is
just Gallic exuberance. Have you ever been really
in love in your life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; said he. But he lit a
cigarette, turned away, and looked out of window.</p>

<p>There was a short silence. He shrugged his
shoulders, apparently in response to his own
thoughts. Then he turned again suddenly, threw
his cigarette into the fire, and thrust his hands into
his pockets. He sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there was Fleurette,&rdquo; said he, not looking
at me. &ldquo;<em>Est-ce qu&#8217;on sait jamais?</em> That wasn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
her real name&mdash;it was Marie-Jos&eacute;phine; but people
called her Fleurette. She looked like a flower, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded in order to signify my elementary acquaintance
with the French tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most delicate little flower you can conceive,&rdquo;
he continued. &ldquo;<em>Tiens</em>, she was a slender lily&mdash;so
white, and her hair the flash of gold on it&mdash;and
she had eyes&mdash;<em>des yeux de pervenche</em>, as we
say in French. What is <em>pervenche</em> in English&mdash;that
little pale-blue flower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Periwinkle,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Periwinkle eyes! My God, what a language!
Ah, no! She had <em>des yeux de pervenche</em>....
She was <em>diaphane</em>, diaphanous ... impalpable
as cigarette-smoke ... a little nose like nothing
at all, with nostrils like infinitesimal sea-shells.
Anyone could have made a mouthful of her....
Ah! <em>Cr&eacute; nom d&#8217;un chien!</em> Life is droll. It has no
common sense. It is the game of a mountebank....
I&#8217;ve never told you about Fleurette. It
was this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the story he narrated I will do my best to
set down.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The good M. Bocardon, of the H&ocirc;tel de
la Curatterie at N&icirc;mes, whose grateful devotion
to Aristide has already been recorded, had
a brother in Paris who managed the H&ocirc;tel du
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Soleil et de l&#8217;Ecosse (strange conjuncture), a
flourishing third-rate hostelry in the neighbourhood
of the Halles Centrales. Thither flocked sturdy
Britons in knickerbockers, stockings, and cloth caps,
Teutons with tin botanizing boxes (for lunch transportation),
and American school-marms realizing
at last the dream of their modest and laborious
lives. Accommodation was cheap, manners were
easy, and knowledge of the gay city less than rudimentary.</p>

<p>To M. Bocardon of Paris Aristide, one August
morning, brought glowing letters of introduction
from M. and Mme. Bocardon of N&icirc;mes. M. Bocardon
of Paris welcomed Aristide as a Proven&ccedil;al
and a brother. He brought out from a cupboard in
his private bureau an hospitable bottle of old Armagnac,
and discoursed with Aristide on the seductions
of the South. It was there that he longed
to retire&mdash;to a dainty little hotel of his own with
a smart client&egrave;le. The client&egrave;le of the H&ocirc;tel du
Soleil et de l&#8217;Ecosse was not to his taste. He spoke
slightingly of his guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are people who know how to travel,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;and people who don&#8217;t. These lost muttons
here don&#8217;t, and they make hotel-keeping a
nightmare instead of a joy. A hundred times a
day have I to tell them the way to Notre Dame.
<em>Pouah!</em>&rdquo; said he, gulping down his disgust and
the rest of his Armagnac, &ldquo;it is back-breaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>Tu sais, mon vieux</em>,&rdquo; cried Aristide&mdash;he had
the most lightning way of establishing an intimacy&mdash;&ldquo;I
have an idea. These lost sheep need a shepherd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Eh bien?</em>&rdquo; said M. Bocardon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Eh bien</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;Why should not I
be the shepherd, the official shepherd attached to
the H&ocirc;tel du Soleil et de l&#8217;Ecosse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explain yourself,&rdquo; said M. Bocardon.</p>

<p>Aristide, letting loose his swift imagination, explained
copiously, and hypnotized M. Bocardon
with his glittering eye, until he had assured to himself
a means of livelihood. From that moment he
became the familiar genius of the hotel. Scorning
the title of &ldquo;guide,&rdquo; lest he should be associated in
the minds of the guests with the squalid scoundrels
who infest the Boulevard, he constituted himself
&ldquo;Directeur de l&#8217;Agence Pujol.&rdquo; An obfuscated Bocardon
formed the rest of the agency and pocketed
a percentage of Aristide&#8217;s earnings, and Aristide,
addressed as &ldquo;Director&rdquo; by the Anglo-Saxons, &ldquo;M.
le Directeur&rdquo; by the Latins, and &ldquo;Herr Direktor&rdquo;
by the Teutons, walked about like a peacock in a
barn-yard.</p>

<img src="images/img210.jpg" width="600" height="422" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">he must have dealt out paralyzing information</span>
</div>

<p>At that period, and until he had learned up Baedeker
by heart, a process which nearly gave him
brain-fever, and still, he declares, brings terror
into his slumbers, he knew little more of the history,
topography, and art-treasures of Paris than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the flock he shepherded. He must have dealt out
paralyzing information. The Britons and the Germans
seemed not to heed; but now and then the
American school-marms unmasked the charlatan.
On such occasions his unfaltering impudence
reached heights truly sublime. The sharp-witted
ladies looked in his eyes, forgot their wrongs, and,
if he had told them that the Eiffel Tower had been
erected by the Pilgrim Fathers, would have accepted
the statement meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Aristide, with Proven&ccedil;al flourish
and braggadocio, &ldquo;I never met a woman that
would not sooner be misled by me than be taught
by the whole Faculty of the Sorbonne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had been practising this honourable profession
for about a month, lodging with the good
Mme. Bidoux at 213 bis, Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;, when,
one morning, in the vestibule of the hotel, he ran
into his old friend Batterby, whom he had known
during the days of his professorship of French at
the Academy for Young Ladies in Manchester.
The pair had been fellow-lodgers in the same house
in the Rusholme Road; but, whereas Aristide lived
in one sunless bed-sitting-room looking on a forest
of chimney-pots, Batterby, man of luxury and ease,
had a suite of apartments on the first floor and kept
an inexhaustible supply of whisky, cigars, and such-like
etceteras of the opulent, and the very ugliest
prize bull-pup you can imagine. Batterby, in gaudy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
raiment, went to an office in Manchester; in gaudier
raiment he often attended race meetings. He
had rings and scarf-pins and rattled gold in his
trousers pockets. He might have been an insufferable
young man for a poverty-stricken teacher
of French to have as a fellow-lodger; but he was
not. Like all those born to high estate, he made
no vulgar parade of his wealth, and to Aristide he
showed the most affable hospitality. A friendship
had arisen between them, which the years had
idealized rather than impaired. So when they met
that morning in the vestibule of the H&ocirc;tel du
Soleil et de l&#8217;Ecosse their greetings were fervent
and prolonged.</p>

<p>In person Batterby tended towards burliness. He
had a red, jolly face, divided unequally by a great
black moustache, and his manner was hearty. He
slapped Aristide on the back many times and shook
him by the shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must have a drink on this straight away,
old man,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re so strange, you English,&rdquo; said Aristide.
&ldquo;The moment you have an emotion you must celebrate
it by a drink. &lsquo;My dear fellow, I&#8217;ve just
come into a fortune; let us have a drink.&rsquo; Or,
&lsquo;My friend, my poor old father has just been
run over by an omnibus; let us have a drink.&rsquo; My
good Reginald, look at the clock. It is only nine
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; said Reginald. &ldquo;Drink is good at any
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went into the dark and deserted smoking-room,
where Batterby ordered Scotch and soda and
Aristide, an abstemious man, a plain vermouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s that muck?&rdquo; asked Batterby, when the
waiter brought the drinks. Aristide explained.
&ldquo;Whisky&#8217;s good enough for me,&rdquo; laughed the other.
Aristide laughed too, out of politeness and out of
joy at meeting his old friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you playing at guide here,&rdquo; said Batterby,
when he had learned Aristide&#8217;s position in the hotel,
&ldquo;it seems I have come to the right shop. There
are no flies on me, you know, but when a man
comes to Paris for the first time he likes to be put
up to the ropes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your first visit to Paris?&rdquo; cried Aristide. &ldquo;<em>Mon
vieux</em>, what wonders are going to ravish your eyes!
What a time you are going to have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Batterby bit off the end of a great black cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the missus will let me,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missus? Your wife? You are married, my
dear Reginald?&rdquo; Aristide leaped, in his unexpected
fashion, from his chair and almost embraced him.
&ldquo;Ah, but you are happy, you are lucky. It was
always like that. You open your mouth and the
larks fall ready roasted into it! My congratulations.
And she is here, in this hotel, your wife?
Tell me about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Batterby lit his cigar. &ldquo;She&#8217;s nothing to write
home about,&rdquo; he said, modestly. &ldquo;She&#8217;s French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;French? No&mdash;you don&#8217;t say so!&rdquo; exclaimed
Aristide, in ecstasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she was brought up in France from her
childhood, but her parents were Finns. Funny place
for people to come from&mdash;Finland&mdash;isn&#8217;t it? You
could never expect it&mdash;might just as well think of
&#8217;em coming from Lapland. She&#8217;s an orphan. I
met her in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&#8217;s romantic! And she is young,
pretty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; in a way,&rdquo; said the proprietary Briton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she has a fool name&mdash;Fleurette. I wanted
to call her Flossie, but she didn&#8217;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;Fleurette
is an adorable name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&#8217;s right enough,&rdquo; said Batterby.
&ldquo;But if I want to call her good old Flossie, why
should she object? You married, old man? No?
Well, wait till you are. You think women are
angels all wrapped up in feathers and wings beneath
their toggery, don&#8217;t you? Well, they&#8217;re just
blooming porcupines, all bristling with objections.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mais, allons, donc!</em>&rdquo; cried Aristide. &ldquo;You love
her, your beautiful Finnish orphan brought up in
France and romantically met in London, with the
adorable name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&rdquo; said the easy Batterby,
lifting his half-emptied glass. &ldquo;Here&#8217;s luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;no!&rdquo; said Aristide, leaning forward and
clinking his wineglass against the other&#8217;s tumbler.
&ldquo;Here is to madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they returned to the vestibule they found
Mrs. Batterby patiently awaiting her lord. She
rose from her seat at the approach of the two men,
a fragile flower of a girl, about three-and-twenty,
pale as a lily, with exquisite though rather large
features, and with eyes of the blue of the <em>pervenche</em>
(in deference to Aristide I use the French name),
which seemed to smile trustfully through perpetual
tears. She was dressed in pale, shadowy blue&mdash;graceful,
impalpable, like the smoke, said Aristide,
curling upwards from a cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reggie has spoken of you many times, monsieur,&rdquo;
said Fleurette, after the introduction had
been effected.</p>

<p>Aristide was touched. &ldquo;Fancy him remembering
me! <em>Ce bon vieux Reginald.</em> Madame,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;your husband is the best fellow in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feed him with sugar and he won&#8217;t bite,&rdquo; said
Batterby; whereat they all laughed, as if it had
been a very good joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what about this Paris of yours?&rdquo; he asked,
after a while. &ldquo;The missus knows as little of it
as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; asked Aristide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
&ldquo;I lived all my life in Brest before I went to
England,&rdquo; she said, modestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wants to see all the sights, the Louvre, the
Morgue, the Cathedral of What&#8217;s-its-name that
you&#8217;ve got here. I&#8217;ve got to go round, too. Pleases
her and don&#8217;t hurt me. You must tote us about.
We&#8217;ll have a cab, old girl, as you can&#8217;t do much
walking, and good old Pujol will come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is ideal!&rdquo; cried Aristide, flying to the
door to order the cab; but before he could reach
it he was stopped by three or four waiting tourists,
who pointed, some to the clock, some to the wagonette
standing outside, and asked the director
when the personally-conducted party was to start.
Aristide, who had totally forgotten the responsibilities
attached to the directorship of the Agence
Pujol and, but for this reminder, would have blissfully
left his sheep to err and stray over Paris by
themselves, returned crestfallen to his friends and
explained the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&#8217;ll join the party,&rdquo; said the cheery Batterby.
&ldquo;The more the merrier&mdash;good old bean-feast!
Will there be room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; replied Aristide, brightening. &ldquo;But
would it meet the wishes of madame?&rdquo; Her pale
face flushed ever so slightly and the soft eyes fluttered
at him a half-astonished, half-grateful glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With my husband and you, monsieur, I should
love it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
So Mr. and Mrs. Batterby joined the personally-conducted
party, as they did the next morning, and
the next, and several mornings after, and received
esoteric information concerning the monuments of
Paris that is hidden even from the erudite. The
evenings, however, Aristide, being off duty, devoted
to their especial entertainment. He took them to
riotous and perspiring restaurants where they dined
gorgeously for three francs fifty, wine included;
to open-air <em>caf&eacute;s-concerts</em> in the Champs Elys&eacute;es,
which Fleurette found infinitely diverting, but
which bored Batterby, who knew not French, to
stertorous slumber; to crowded brasseries on the
Boulevard, where Batterby awakened, under a
steady flow of whisky, to appreciative contemplation
of Paris life. As in the old days of the Rusholme
Road, Batterby flung his money about with
unostentatious generosity. He was out for a beano,
he declared, and hang the expense! Aristide,
whose purse, scantily filled (truth to say) by the
profits of the Agence Pujol, could contribute but
modestly to this reckless expenditure, found himself
forced to accept his friend&#8217;s lavish hospitality.
Once or twice, delicately, he suggested withdrawal
from the evening&#8217;s dissipation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my good M. Pujol,&rdquo; said Fleurette, with
childish tragicality in her <em>pervenche</em> eyes, &ldquo;without
you we shall be lost. We shall not enjoy ourselves
at all, at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
So Aristide, out of love for his friend, and out
of he knew not what for his friend&#8217;s wife, continued
to show them the sights of Paris. They went
to the cabarets of Montmartre&mdash;the <em>Ciel</em>, where
one is served by angels; the <em>Enfer</em>, where one is
served by red devils in a Tartarean lighting; the
<em>N&eacute;ant</em>, where one has coffins for tables&mdash;than all of
which vulgarity has imagined no more joy-killing
dreariness, but which caused Fleurette to grip Aristide&#8217;s
hand tight in scared wonderment and Batterby
to chuckle exceedingly. They went to the
Bal Bullier and to various other balls undreamed of
by the tourist, where Fleurette danced with Aristide,
as light as an autumn leaf tossed by the wind,
and Batterby absorbed a startling assortment of
alcohols. In a word, Aristide procured for his
friends prodigious diversion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like this, old girl?&rdquo; Batterby asked
one night, at the Moulin de la Galette, a dizzying,
not very decorous, and to the unsophisticated visitor
a dangerous place of entertainment. &ldquo;Better
than Great Coram Street, isn&#8217;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled and laid her hand on his. She was
a woman of few words but of many caressing
actions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to let you into a secret,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;This
is our honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who would have thought it?&rdquo;</p>

<a name="img220" id="img220"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">
<img src="images/img220.jpg" width="401" height="600" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">fleurette danced with aristide, as light as an autumn leaf
tossed by the wind</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;A fortnight ago she was being killed in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Bloomsbury boarding-house. There were two of
&#8217;em&mdash;she and a girl called Carrie. I used to call
&#8217;em Fetch and Carrie. This one was Fetch. Well,
she fetched me, didn&#8217;t you, old girl? And now
you&#8217;re Mrs. Reginald Batterby, living at your ease,
eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame would grace any sphere,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had more education,&rdquo; said Fleurette,
humbly. &ldquo;M. Pujol and yourself are so clever that
you must laugh at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do sometimes, but you mustn&#8217;t mind us.
Remember&mdash;at the what-you-call-it&mdash;the little
shanty at Versailles&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Grand Trianon,&rdquo; replied Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s it. When you were showing us the
rooms. &lsquo;What is the Empress Josephine doing
now?&rsquo;&rdquo; He mimicked her accent. &ldquo;Ha! ha! And
the poor soul gone to glory a couple of hundred
years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little mouth puckered at the corners and
moisture gathered in the blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mais, mon Dieu</em>, it was natural, the mistake,&rdquo;
cried Aristide, gallantly. &ldquo;The Empress Eug&eacute;nie,
the wife of another Napoleon, is still living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Bien s&ucirc;r</em>,&rdquo; said Fleurette. &ldquo;How was I to
know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, old girl,&rdquo; said Batterby. &ldquo;You&#8217;re
living all right, and out of that beastly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
boarding-house, and that&#8217;s the chief thing. Another month
of it would have killed her. She had a cough that
shook her to bits. She&#8217;s looking better already,
isn&#8217;t she, Pujol?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this Aristide learned much of her simple
history, which she, at first, had been too shy to
reveal. The child of Finnish sea-folk who had
drifted to Brest and died there, she had been
adopted by an old Breton sea-dog and his wife.
On their death she had entered, as maid, the service
of an English lady residing in the town, who afterwards
had taken her to England. After a while
reverses of fortune had compelled the lady to dismiss
her, and she had taken the situation in the
boarding-house, where she had ruined her health
and met the opulent and conquering Batterby.
She had not much chance, poor child, of acquiring
a profound knowledge of the history of the First
Empire; but her manners were refined and her ways
gentle and her voice was soft; and Aristide, citizen
of the world, for whom caste distinctions existed
not, thought her the most exquisite flower grown in
earth&#8217;s garden. He told her so, much to her blushing
satisfaction.</p>

<p>One night, about three weeks after the Batterbys&#8217;
arrival in Paris, Batterby sent his wife to bed
and invited Aristide to accompany him for half
an hour to a neighbouring caf&eacute;. He looked grave
and troubled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&#8217;ve been upset by a telegram,&rdquo; said he, when
drinks had been ordered. &ldquo;I&#8217;m called away to New
York on business. I must catch the boat from
Cherbourg to-morrow evening. Now, I can&#8217;t take
Fleurette with me. Women and business don&#8217;t mix.
She has jolly well got to stay here. I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be
away more than a month. I&#8217;ll leave her plenty
of money to go on with. But what&#8217;s worrying me
is&mdash;how is she going to stick it? So look here, old
man, you&#8217;re my pal, aren&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand. Aristide grasped it
impulsively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, <em>mon vieux!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I felt that I could leave her in your charge,
all on the square, as a real straight pal&mdash;I should
go away happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall be my sister,&rdquo; cried Aristide, &ldquo;and I
shall give her all the devotion of a brother....
I swear it&mdash;<em>tiens</em>&mdash;what can I swear it on?&rdquo; He
flung out his arms and looked round the caf&eacute; as
if in search of an object. &ldquo;I swear it on the head
of my mother. Have no fear. I, Aristide Pujol,
have never betrayed the sacred obligations of
friendship. I accept her as a consecrated trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You only need to have said &lsquo;Right-o,&rsquo; and I
would have believed you,&rdquo; said Batterby. &ldquo;I
haven&#8217;t told her yet. There&#8217;ll be blubbering all
night. Let us have another drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Aristide arrived at the H&ocirc;tel du Soleil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
et de l&#8217;Ecosse at nine o&#8217;clock the next morning he
found that Batterby had left Paris by an early
train. Fleurette he did not meet until he brought
back the sight-seers to the fold in the evening. She
had wept much during the day; but she smiled
bravely on Aristide. A woman could not stand in
the way of her husband&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, what is Reginald&#8217;s business?&rdquo;
Aristide asked.</p>

<p>She did not know. Reginald never spoke to
her of such things; perhaps she was too ignorant
to understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he will make a lot of money by going to
America,&rdquo; she said. Then she was silent for a
few moments. &ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu!</em>&rdquo; she sighed, at last.
&ldquo;How long the day has been!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the beginning of many long days for
Fleurette. Reginald did not write from Cherbourg
or cable from New York, as he had promised,
and the return American mail brought no
letter. The days passed drearily. Sometimes, for
the sake of human society, she accompanied the
tourist parties of the Agence Pujol; but the thrill
had passed from the Morgue and the glory had
departed from Versailles. Sometimes she wandered
out by herself into the streets and public
gardens; but, pretty, unprotected, and fragile, she
attracted the attention of evil or careless men,
which struck cold terror into her heart. Most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
often she sat alone and listless in the hotel, reading
the feuilleton of the <em>Petit Journal</em>, and waiting
for the post to bring her news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu</em>, M. Pujol, what can have happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, <em>ch&egrave;re petite madame</em>&rdquo;&mdash;question
and answer came many times a day. &ldquo;Only some
foolish mischance which will soon be explained.
The good Reginald has written and his letter has
been lost in the post. He has been obliged to go
on business to San Francisco or Buenos Ayres&mdash;<em>et,
que voulez-vous?</em> one cannot have letters from
those places in twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only he had taken me with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, dear Mme. Fleurette, he could not expose
you to the hardships of travel. You, who are as
fragile as a cobweb, how could you go to Patagonia
or Senegal or Baltimore, those wild places
where there are no comforts for women? You
must be reasonable. I am sure you will get a letter
soon&mdash;or else in a day or two he will come,
with his good, honest face as if nothing had occurred&mdash;these
English are like that&mdash;and call for
whisky and soda. Be comforted, <em>ch&egrave;re petite madame</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide did his best to comfort her, threw her
in the companionship of decent women staying at
the hotel, and devoted his evenings to her entertainment.
But the days passed, and Reginald Batterby,
with the good, honest face, neither wrote
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
nor ordered whisky and soda. Fleurette began
to pine and fade.</p>

<p>One day she came to Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. Pujol, I have no more money left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Bigre!</em>&rdquo; said Pujol. &ldquo;The good Bocardon will
have to give you credit. I&#8217;ll arrange it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I already owe for three weeks,&rdquo; said Fleurette.</p>

<p>Aristide sought Bocardon. One week more was
all the latter dared allow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But her husband will return and pay you. He
is my old and intimate friend. I make myself
hoarse in telling it to you, wooden-head that you
are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bocardon, who had to account to higher
powers, the proprietors of the hotel, was helpless.
At the end of the week Fleurette was called upon
to give up her room. She wept with despair; Aristide
wept with fury; Bocardon wept out of sympathy.
Already, said Bocardon, the proprietors
would blame him for not using the legal right to
detain madame&#8217;s luggage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu! mon Dieu!</em> what is to become of
me?&rdquo; wailed Fleurette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget, madame,&rdquo; said Aristide, with one
of his fine flourishes, &ldquo;that you are the sacred
trust of Aristide Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&#8217;t accept your money,&rdquo; objected Fleurette.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>Tron de l&#8217;air!</em>&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Did your husband
put you in my charge or did he not? Am I your
legal guardian, or am I not? If I am your legal
guardian, what right have you to question the arrangements
made by your husband? Answer me
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fleurette, too gentle and too miserable for intricate
argument, sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is your money, all the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide turned to Bocardon. &ldquo;Try,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to convince a woman! Do you want proofs?
Wait there a minute while I get them from the
safe of the Agence Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He disappeared into the bureau, where, secure
from observation, he tore an oblong strip from a
sheet of stiff paper, and, using an indelible pencil,
wrote out something fantastic halfway between a
cheque and a bill of exchange, forged as well as
he could from memory the signature of Reginald
Batterby&mdash;the imitation of handwriting was one
of Aristide&#8217;s many odd accomplishments&mdash;and made
the document look legal by means of a receipt
stamp, which he took from Bocardon&#8217;s drawer. He
returned to the vestibule with the strip folded and
somewhat crumpled in his hand. &ldquo;<em>Voil&agrave;</em>,&rdquo; said
he, handing it boldly to Fleurette. &ldquo;Here is your
husband&#8217;s guarantee to me, your guardian, for four
thousand francs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fleurette examined the forgery. The stamp
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
impressed her. For the simple souls of France there
is magic in <em>papier timbr&eacute;</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my husband who wrote this?&rdquo; she asked,
curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mais, oui</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide, with an offended air
of challenge.</p>

<p>Fleurette&#8217;s eyes filled again with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only inquired,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because this is the
first time I have seen his handwriting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ma pauvre petite</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do whatever you tell me, M. Pujol,&rdquo;
said Fleurette, humbly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! That is talking like <em>une bonne petite
dame raisonnable</em>. Now, I know a woman made
up of holy bread whom St. Paul and St. Peter
are fighting to have next them when she goes to
Paradise. Her name is Mme. Bidoux, and she
sells cabbages and asparagus and charcoal at No.
213 bis, Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;. She will arrange our
little affair. Bocardon, will you have madame&#8217;s
trunks sent to that address?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave his arm to Fleurette, and walked out of
the hotel, with serene confidence in the powers of
the sainted Mme. Bidoux. Fleurette accompanied
him unquestioningly. Of course she might have
said: &ldquo;If you hold negotiable security from my
husband to the amount of four thousand francs,
why should I exchange the comforts of the hotel
for the doubtful accommodation of the sainted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Mme. Bidoux who sells cabbages?&rdquo; But I repeat
that Fleurette was a simple soul who took for
granted the wisdom of so flamboyant and virile a
creature as Aristide Pujol.</p>

<p>Away up at the top of No. 213 bis, Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;,
was a little furnished room to let, and
there Aristide installed his sacred charge. Mme.
Bidoux, who, as she herself maintained, would
have cut herself into four pieces for Aristide&mdash;did
he not save her dog&#8217;s life? Did he not marry her
daughter to the brigadier of gendarmes (<em>sale
voyou!</em>), who would otherwise have left her lamenting?
Was he not the most wonderful of God&#8217;s
creatures?&mdash;Mme. Bidoux, although not quite appreciating
Aristide&#8217;s quixotic delicacy, took the forlorn
and fragile wisp of misery to her capacious
bosom. She made her free of the cabbages and
charcoal. She provided her, at a risible charge,
with succulent meals. She told her tales of her
father and mother, of her neighbours, of the domestic
differences between the concierge and his
wife (soothing idyll for an Ariadne!), of the dirty
thief of a brigadier of gendarmes, of her bodily
ailments&mdash;her body was so large that they were
many; of the picturesque death, through apoplexy,
of the late M. Bidoux; the brave woman, in short,
gave her of her heart&#8217;s best. As far as human
hearts could provide a bed for Fleurette, that bed
was of roses. As a matter of brutal fact, it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
narrow and nubbly, and the little uncarpeted room
was ten feet by seven; but to provide it Aristide
went to his own bed hungry. And if the bed of a
man&#8217;s hunger is not to be accounted as one of roses,
there ought to be a vote for the reduction of the
Recording Angel&#8217;s salary.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that Fleurette thought
the bed hard. Her bed of life from childhood had
been nubbly. She never dreamed of complaining
of her little room under the stars, and she sat
among the cabbages like a tired lily, quite contented
with her material lot. But she drooped and
drooped, and the cough returned and shook her;
and Aristide, realizing the sacredness of his charge,
became a prey to anxious terrors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&egrave;re Bidoux,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she must have lots
of good, nourishing, tender, underdone beef, good
fillets, and <em>entrec&ocirc;tes saignantes</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mme. Bidoux sighed. She had a heart, but
she also had a pocket which, like Aristide&#8217;s, was
not over-filled. &ldquo;That costs dear, my poor friend,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it matter what it costs? It is I who
provide,&rdquo; said Aristide, grandly.</p>

<p>And Aristide gave up tobacco and coffee and
the mild refreshment at caf&eacute;s essential to the existence
of every Frenchman, and degraded his soul
by taking half-franc tips from tourists&mdash;a source
of income which, as Director, M. le Directeur,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Herr Direktor of the Agence Pujol, he had hitherto
scorned haughtily&mdash;in order to provide Fleurette
with underdone beefsteaks.</p>

<p>All his leisure he devoted to her. She represented
something that hitherto had not come into
his life&mdash;something delicate, tender, ethereal, something
of woman that was exquisitely adorable,
apart from the flesh. Once, as he was sitting in
the little shop, she touched his temple lightly with
her fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are good to me, Aristide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt a thrill such as no woman&#8217;s touch had
ever caused to pass through him&mdash;far, far sweeter,
cleaner, purer. If the <em>bon Dieu</em> could have given
her to him then and there to be his wife, what bond
could have been holier? But he had bound himself
by a sacred obligation. His friend on his return
should find him loyal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who could help being good to you, little Fleurette?&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Even an Apache would not tread
on a lily of the valley!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you put me in water and tend me so carefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that you can be fresh whenever the dear
Reginald comes back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sighed. &ldquo;Tell me what I can do for you,
my good Aristide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep well and happy and be a valiant little
woman,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Fleurette tried hard to be valiant; but the effort
exhausted her strength. As the days went on, even
Aristide&#8217;s inexhaustible conversation failed to distract
her from brooding. She lost the trick of
laughter. In the evenings, when he was most
with her, she would sit, either in the shop or in the
little room at the back, her blue childish eyes fixed
on him wistfully. At first he tried to lure her into
the gay street; but walking tired her. He encouraged
her to sit outside on the pavement of the
Rue Saint-Honor&eacute; and join with Mme. Bidoux
in the gossip of neighbours; but she listened to
them with uncomprehending ears. In despair Aristide,
to coax a smile from her lips, practised his
many queer accomplishments. He conjured with
cards; he juggled with oranges; he had a mountebank&#8217;s
trick of putting one leg round his neck; he
imitated the voices of cats and pigs and ducks,
till Mme. Bidoux held her sides with mirth. He
spent time and thought in elaborating what he
called <em>bonnes farces</em>, such as dressing himself up
in Mme. Bidoux&#8217;s raiment and personifying a
crabbed customer.</p>

<p>Fleurette smiled but listlessly at all these comicalities.</p>

<p>One day she was taken ill. A doctor, summoned,
said many learned words which Aristide and Mme.
Bidoux tried hard to understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, after all, what is the matter with her?&rdquo;</p>

<a name="img234" id="img234"></a>

<span class="caption">aristide practised his many queer accomplishments</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
&ldquo;She has no strength to struggle. She wants
happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me the druggist&#8217;s where that can
be procured?&rdquo; asked Aristide.</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I tell you
the truth. It is one of those pulmonary cases.
Happy, she will live; unhappy, she will die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor Mme. Bidoux, what is to be done?&rdquo;
asked Aristide, after the doctor had gone off with
his modest fee. &ldquo;How are we to make her happy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only she could have news of her husband!&rdquo;
replied Mme. Bidoux.</p>

<p>Aristide&#8217;s anxieties grew heavier. It was November,
when knickerbockered and culture-seeking
tourists no longer fill the cheap hotels of Paris.
The profits of the Agence Pujol dwindled. Aristide
lived on bread and cheese, and foresaw the
time when cheese would be a sinful luxury. Meanwhile
Fleurette had her nourishing food, and grew
more like the ghost of a lily every day. But her
eyes followed Aristide, wherever he went in her
presence, as if he were the god of her salvation.</p>

<p>One day Aristide, with an unexpected franc or
two in his pocket, stopped in front of a <em>bureau de
tabac</em>. A brown packet of caporal and a book of
cigarette-papers&mdash;a cigarette rolled&mdash;how good it
would be! He hesitated, and his glance fell on a
collection of foreign stamps exposed in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
window. Among them were twelve Honduras stamps
all postmarked. He stared at them, fascinated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon brave Aristide!</em>&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If the <em>bon
Dieu</em> does not send you these vibrating inspirations,
it is because you yourself have already conceived
them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He entered the shop and emerged, not with caporal
and cigarette-papers, but with the twelve Honduras
stamps.</p>

<p>That night he sat up in his little bedroom at
No. 213 bis, Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;, until his candle
failed, inditing a letter in English to Fleurette.
At the head of his paper he wrote &ldquo;Hotel Rosario,
Honduras.&rdquo; And at the end of the letter he signed
the name of Reginald Batterby. Where Honduras
was, he had but a vague idea. For Fleurette, at
any rate, it would be somewhere at the other end
of the world, and she would not question any want
of accuracy in local detail. Just before the light
went out he read the letter through with great
pride. Batterby alluded to the many letters he
had posted from remote parts of the globe, gave
glowing forecasts of the fortune that Honduras
had in store for him, reminded her that he had
placed sufficient funds for her maintenance in the
hands of Aristide Pujol, and assured her that the
time was not far off when she would be summoned
to join her devoted husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mme. Bidoux was right,&rdquo; said he, before going
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
to sleep. &ldquo;This is the only way to make her happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day Fleurette received the letter. The
envelope bore the postmarked Honduras stamp. It
had been rubbed on the dusty pavement to take
off the newness. It was in her husband&#8217;s handwriting.
There was no mistake about it&mdash;it was
a letter from Honduras.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you happier now, little doubting female
St. Thomas that you are?&rdquo; cried Aristide when
she had told him the news.</p>

<p>She smiled at him out of grateful eyes, and
touched his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much happier, <em>mon bon ami</em>,&rdquo; she said, gently.</p>

<p>Later in the day she handed him a letter addressed
to Batterby. It had no stamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you post this for me, Aristide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide put the letter in his pocket and turned
sharply away, lest she should see a sudden rush
of tears. He had not counted on this innocent
trustfulness. He went to his room. The poor
little letter! He had not the heart to destroy it.
No; he would keep it till Batterby came; it was not
his to destroy. So he threw it into a drawer.</p>

<p>Having once begun the deception, however, he
thought it necessary to continue. Every week,
therefore, he invented a letter from Batterby. To
interest her he drew upon his Proven&ccedil;al imagination.
He described combats with crocodiles, lion-hunts,
feasts with terrific savages from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
interior, who brought their lady wives chastely clad
in petticoats made out of human teeth; he drew
pictures of the town, a kind of palm-shaded Paris
by the sea, where one ate ortolans and oysters as
big as soup-plates, and where Chinamen with pigtails
rode about the streets on camels. It was not
a correct description of Honduras, but, all the
same, an exotic atmosphere stimulating and captivating
rose from the pages. With this it was necessary
to combine expressions of affection. At
first it was difficult. Essential delicacy restrained
him. He had also to keep in mind Batterby&#8217;s vernacular.
To address Fleurette, impalpable creation
of fairyland, as &ldquo;old girl&rdquo; was particularly distasteful.
By degrees, however, the artist prevailed.
And then at last the man himself took to forgetting
the imaginary writer and poured out words of love,
warm, true, and passionate.</p>

<p>And every week Fleurette would smile and tell
him the wondrous news, and would put into his
hands an unstamped letter to post, which he, with
a wrench of the heart, would add to the collection
in the drawer.</p>

<p>Once she said, diffidently, with an unwonted
blush and her pale blue eyes swimming: &ldquo;I write
English so badly. Won&#8217;t you read the letter and
correct my mistakes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Aristide laughed and licked the flap of the
envelope and closed it. &ldquo;What has love to do with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
spelling and grammar? The good Reginald would
prefer your bad English to all the turned phrases
of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as you like, Aristide,&rdquo; said Fleurette, with
wistful eyes.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of the weekly letters, Fleurette continued
to droop. The winter came, and Fleurette
was no longer able to stay among the cabbages of
Mme. Bidoux. She lay on her bed in the little
room, ten feet by seven, away, away at the top of
the house in the Rue Saint Honor&eacute;. The doctor,
informed of her comparative happiness, again
shrugged his shoulders. There was nothing more
to be done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is dying, monsieur, for want of strength
to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Aristide went about with a great heartache.
Fleurette would die; she would never see
the man she loved again. What would he say when
he returned and learned the tragic story? He
would not even know that Aristide, loving her, had
been loyal to him. When the Director of the
Agence Pujol personally conducted the clients of
the H&ocirc;tel du Soleil et de l&#8217;Ecosse to the Grand
Trianon and pointed out the bed of the Empress
Josephine he nearly broke down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the Empress doing now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was Fleurette doing now? Going to join
the Empress in the world of shadows.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
The tourists talked after the manner of their
kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have found the bed very hard, poor
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me an iron bedstead and a good old spring
mattress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but, my dear sir, you forget. The Empress&#8217;s
bed was slung on the back of tame panthers
which Napoleon brought from Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was hard to jest convincingly to the knickerbockered
with death in one&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most belov&egrave;d little Flower,&rdquo; ran the last letter
that Fleurette received, &ldquo;I have just had a cable
from Aristide saying that you are very ill. I will
come to you as soon as I can. <em>Ces petits yeux de
pervenche</em>&mdash;I am learning your language here, you
see&mdash;haunt me day and night ...&rdquo; etcetera,
etcetera.</p>

<p>Aristide went up to her room with a great bunch
of chrysanthemums. The letter peeped from under
the pillow. Fleurette was very weak. Mme. Bidoux,
who, during Fleurette&#8217;s illness, had allowed
her green grocery business to be personally conducted
to the deuce by a youth of sixteen very
much in love with the lady who sold sausages and
other <em>charcuterie</em> next door, had spread out the
fortune-telling cards on the bed and was prophesying
mendaciously. Fleurette took the flowers and
clasped them to her bosom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
&ldquo;No letter for <em>ce cher Reginald</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I can write no more,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes. Presently she said, in a
low voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aristide&mdash;if you kiss me, I think I can go to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bent down to kiss her forehead. A fragile
arm twined itself about his neck and he kissed her
on the lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is sleeping,&rdquo; said Mme. Bidoux, after a
while.</p>

<p>Aristide tiptoed out of the room.</p>

<p>And so died Fleurette. Aristide borrowed money
from the kind-hearted Bocardon for a beautiful
funeral, and Mme. Bidoux and Bocardon and a
few neighbours and himself saw her laid to rest.
When they got back to the Rue Saint Honor&eacute; he
told Mme. Bidoux about the letters. She wept and
clasped him, weeping too, in her kind, fat old arms.</p>

<p>The next evening Aristide, coming back from his
day&#8217;s work at the H&ocirc;tel du Soleil et de l&#8217;Ecosse,
was confronted in the shop by Mme. Bidoux,
hands on broad hips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tiens, mon petit</em>,&rdquo; she said, without preliminary
greeting. &ldquo;You are an angel. I knew it. But
that a man&#8217;s an angel is no reason for his being an
imbecile. Read this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She plucked a paper from her apron pocket and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
thrust it into his hand. He read it, and blinked in
amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get this, M&egrave;re Bidoux?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where I got many more. In your drawer.
The letters you were saving for this infamous
scoundrel. I wanted to know what she had written
to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&egrave;re Bidoux!&rdquo; cried Aristide. &ldquo;Those letters
were sacred!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Mme. Bidoux, unabashed. &ldquo;There
is nothing sacred to a sapper or an old grandmother
who loves an imbecile. I have read the letters, <em>et
voil&agrave;, et voil&agrave;, et voil&agrave;!</em>&rdquo; And she emptied her
pockets of all the letters, minus the envelopes, that
Fleurette had written.</p>

<p>And, after one swift glance at the first letter,
Aristide had no compunction in reading. They
were all addressed to himself.</p>

<p>They were very short, ill-written in a poor little
uncultivated hand. But they all contained one message,
that of her love for Aristide. Whatever illusions
she may have had concerning Batterby had
soon vanished. She knew, with the unerring instinct
of woman, that he had betrayed and deserted
her. Aristide&#8217;s pious fraud had never deceived her
for a second. Too gentle, too timid to let him
know what was in her heart, she had written the
secret patiently week after week, hoping every time
that curiosity, or pity, or something&mdash;she knew not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
what&mdash;would induce him to open the idle letter, and
wondering in her simple peasant&#8217;s soul at the
delicacy that caused him to refrain. Once she had
boldly given him the envelope unclosed.</p>

<a name="img244" id="img244"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/img244.jpg" width="465" height="500" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">he read it, and blinked in amazement</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;She died for want of love, <em>parbleu</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide,
&ldquo;and there was mine quivering in my heart
and trembling on my lips all the time.... She
had <em>des yeux de pervenche</em>. Ah! <em>nom d&#8217;un chien!</em>
It is only with me that Providence plays such
tricks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked to the window and looked out into
the grey street. Presently I heard him murmuring
the words of the old French song:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
Elle est morte en f&eacute;vrier;<br />
    Pauvre Colinette!</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE ADVENTURE OF THE MIRACLE</strong></p>


<p>You have seen how Aristide, by attaching
himself to the H&ocirc;tel du Soleil et de l&#8217;Ecosse
as a kind of glorified courier, had founded
the Agence Pujol. As he, personally, was the
Agence, and the Agence was he, it happened that
when he was not in attendance at the hotel, the
Agence faded into space, and when he made his
appearance in the vestibule and hung up his placard
by the bureau, the Agence at once burst again into
the splendour of existence. Apparently the fitful
career of the Agence Pujol lasted some years.
Whenever a chance of more remunerative employment
turned up, Aristide took it and dissolved the
Agence. Whenever outrageous fortune chivied
him with slings and arrows penniless to Paris, there
was always the Agence waiting to be resuscitated.</p>

<p>It was during one of these periodic flourishings
of the Agence Pujol that Aristide met the Ducksmiths.</p>

<p>Business was slack, few guests were at the hotel,
and of those few none desired to be personally
conducted to the Louvre or Notre Dame or the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
monument in the Place de la Bastille. They mostly
wore the placid expression of folks engaged in business
affairs instead of the worried look of pleasure-seekers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good Bocardon,&rdquo; said Aristide, lounging
by the bureau and addressing his friend the manager,
&ldquo;this is becoming desperate. In another
minute I shall take you out by main force and show
you the Pont Neuf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the door of the stuffy salon
opened, and a travelling Briton, whom Aristide
had not seen before, advanced to the bureau and
inquired his way to the Madeleine. Aristide turned
on him like a flash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, extracting documents from his
pockets with lightning rapidity, &ldquo;nothing would
give me greater pleasure than to conduct you
thither. My card. My tariff. My advertisement.&rdquo;
He pointed to the placard. &ldquo;I am the managing director
of the Agence Pujol, under the special patronage
of this hotel. I undertake all travelling arrangements,
from the Moulin Rouge to the Pyramids,
and, as you see, my charges are moderate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Briton, holding the documents in a pudgy
hand, looked at the swift-gestured director with
portentous solemnity. Then, with equal solemnity,
he looked at Bocardon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Ducksmith,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;you can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
repose every confidence in Monsieur Aristide
Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said Mr. Ducksmith.</p>

<p>After another solemn inspection of Aristide, he
stuck a pair of gold-rimmed glasses on his fleshy
nose and perused the documents. He was a fat,
heavy man of about fifty years of age, and his
scanty hair was turning grey. His puffy cheeks
hung jowl-like, giving him the appearance of some
odd dog&mdash;a similarity greatly intensified by the
eye-sockets, the lower lids of which were dragged
down in the middle, showing the red like a bloodhound&#8217;s;
but here the similarity ended, for the
man&#8217;s eyes, dull and blue, had the unspeculative
fixity of a rabbit&#8217;s. His mouth, small and weak,
dribbled away at the corners into the jowls which,
in their turn, melted into two or three chins. He
was decently dressed in grey tweeds, and wore a
diamond ring on his little finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said he, at last; and went back to the
salon.</p>

<p>As soon as the door closed behind him Aristide
sprang into an attitude of indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such a bear! If I ever saw
a bigger one I would eat him without salt or pepper.
<em>Mais nom d&#8217;un chien</em>, such people ought to
be made into sausages!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Fl&egrave;gme britannique!</em>&rdquo; laughed Bocardon.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed, and Mr. Ducksmith made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
no reappearance from the salon. In the forlorn
hope of a client Aristide went in after him. He
found Mr. Ducksmith, glasses on nose, reading a
newspaper, and a plump, black-haired lady, with an
expressionless face, knitting a grey woollen sock.
Why they should be spending their first morning&mdash;and
a crisp, sunny morning, too&mdash;in Paris in the
murky staleness of this awful little salon, Aristide
could not imagine. As he entered, Mr. Ducksmith
regarded him vacantly over the top of his gold-rimmed
glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have looked in,&rdquo; said Aristide, with his ingratiating
smile, &ldquo;to see whether you are ready to
go to the Madeleine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madeleine?&rdquo; the lady inquired, softly, pausing
in her knitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; Aristide came forward, and, hand
on heart, made her the lowest of bows. &ldquo;Madame,
have I the honour of speaking to Madame Ducksmith?
Enchanted, madame, to make your acquaintance,&rdquo;
he continued, after a grunt from Mr.
Ducksmith had assured him of the correctness of
his conjecture. &ldquo;I am Monsieur Aristide Pujol,
director of the Agence Pujol, and my poor services
are absolutely at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew himself up, twisted his moustache, and
met her eyes&mdash;they were rather sad and tired&mdash;with
the roguish mockery of his own. She turned
to her husband.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
&ldquo;Are you thinking of going to the Madeleine,
Bartholomew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, Henrietta,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have decided to
do it. And I have also decided to put ourselves
in the charge of this gentleman. Mrs. Ducksmith
and I are accustomed to all the conveniences of
travel&mdash;I may say that we are great travellers&mdash;and
I leave it to you to make the necessary arrangements.
I prefer to travel at so much per head per
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke in a wheezy, solemn monotone, from
which all elements of life and joy seemed to have
been eliminated. His wife&#8217;s voice, though softer
in timbre, was likewise devoid of colour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband finds that it saves us from responsibilities,&rdquo;
she remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And over-charges, and the necessity of learning
foreign languages, which at our time of life would
be difficult. During all our travels we have not
been to Paris before, owing to the impossibility of
finding a personally-conducted tour of an adequate
class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear sir,&rdquo; cried Aristide, &ldquo;it is Providence
itself that has put you in the way of the
Agence Pujol. I will now conduct you to the
Madeleine without the least discomfort or danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put on your hat, Henrietta,&rdquo; said Mr. Ducksmith,
&ldquo;while this gentleman and I discuss terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ducksmith gathered up her knitting and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
retired, Aristide dashing to the door to open it for
her. This gallantry surprised her ever so little, for
a faint flush came into her cheek and the shadow of
a smile into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you to understand, Mr. Pujol,&rdquo; said Mr.
Ducksmith, &ldquo;that being, I may say, a comparatively
rich man, I can afford to pay for certain luxuries;
but I made a resolution many years ago, which has
stood me in good stead during my business life,
that I would never be cheated. You will find me
liberal but just.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was as good as his word. Aristide, who had
never in his life exploited another&#8217;s wealth to his
own advantage, suggested certain terms, on the
basis of so much per head per day, which Mr.
Ducksmith declared, with a sigh of relief, to be
perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said he, after further conversation,
&ldquo;you will be good enough to schedule out a month&#8217;s
railway tour through France, and give me an inclusive
estimate for the three of us. As I say, Mrs.
Ducksmith and I are great travellers&mdash;we have
been to Norway, to Egypt, to Morocco and the
Canaries, to the Holy Land, to Rome, and lovely
Lucerne&mdash;but we find that attention to the trivial
detail of travel militates against our enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;trust in me, and
your path and that of the charming Mrs. Ducksmith
will be strewn with roses.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Whereupon Mrs. Ducksmith appeared, arrayed
for walking out, and Aristide, having ordered a
cab, drove with them to the Madeleine. They
alighted in front of the majestic flight of steps.
Mr. Ducksmith stared at the classical portico supported
on its Corinthian columns with his rabbit-like,
unspeculative gaze&mdash;he had those filmy blue
eyes that never seem to wink&mdash;and after a moment
or two turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ducksmith, dutiful and silent, turned away
also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This sacred edifice,&rdquo; Aristide began, in his best
cicerone manner, &ldquo;was built, after a classic model,
by the great Napoleon, as a Temple of Fame. It
was afterwards used as a church. You will observe&mdash;and,
if you care to, you can count, as a conscientious
American lady did last week&mdash;the fifty-six
Corinthian columns. You will see they are Corinthian
by the acanthus leaves on the capitals. For
the vulgar, who have no architectural knowledge,
I have <em>memoria technica</em> for the instant recognition
of the three orders&mdash;Cabbages, Corinthian; horns,
Ionic; anything else, Doric. We will now mount
the steps and inspect the interior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was dashing off in his eager fashion, when
Mr. Ducksmith laid a detaining hand on his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, solemnly. &ldquo;I disapprove of
Popish interiors. Take us to the next place.&rdquo;</p>

<a name="img254" id="img254"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">he might as well have pointed out the marvels of kubla khan&#8217;s
pleasure-dome to a couple of guinea-pigs</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
He entered the waiting victoria. His wife
meekly followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose the Louvre is the next place?&rdquo; said
Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I leave it to you,&rdquo; said Mr. Ducksmith.</p>

<p>Aristide gave the order to the cabman and took
the little seat in the cab facing his employers. On
the way down the Rue Royale and the Rue de
Rivoli he pointed out the various buildings of interest&mdash;Maxim&#8217;s,
the Cercle Royal, the Minist&egrave;re
de la Marine, the H&ocirc;tel Continental. Two expressionless
faces, two pairs of unresponsive eyes, met
his merry glance. He might as well have pointed
out the marvels of Kubla Khan&#8217;s pleasure-dome to
a couple of guinea-pigs.</p>

<p>The cab stopped at the entrance to the galleries
of the Louvre. They entered and walked up the
great staircase on the turn of which the Winged
Victory stands, with the wind of God in her vesture,
proclaiming to each beholder the deathless,
ever-soaring, ever-conquering spirit of man,
and heralding the immortal glories of the souls,
wind-swept likewise by the wind of God,
that are enshrined in the treasure-houses beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph! No head,&rdquo; said Mr. Ducksmith, passing
it by with scarcely a glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it cost very much to get a new one?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
asked Mrs. Ducksmith, timidly. She was three or
four paces behind her spouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would cost the blood and tears and laughter
of the human race,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>(&ldquo;That was devilish good, wasn&#8217;t it?&rdquo; remarked
Aristide, when telling me this story. He always
took care not to hide his light under the least possibility
of a bushel.)</p>

<p>The Ducksmiths looked at him in their lacklustre
way, and allowed themselves to be guided
into the picture-galleries, vaguely hearing Aristide&#8217;s
comments, scarcely glancing at the pictures,
and manifesting no sign of interest in anything
whatever. From the Louvre they drove to Notre
Dame, where the same thing happened. The
venerable pile, standing imperishable amid the vicissitudes
of centuries (the phrase was that of the
director of the Agence Pujol), stirred in their
bosoms no perceptible emotion. Mr. Ducksmith
grunted and declined to enter; Mrs. Ducksmith
said nothing.</p>

<p>As with pictures and cathedrals, so it was with
their food at lunch. Beyond a solemn statement
to the effect that in their quality of practised
travellers they made a point of eating the food and
drinking the wine of the country, Mr. Ducksmith
did not allude to the meal. At any rate, thought
Aristide, they don&#8217;t clamour for underdone chops
and tea. So far they were human. Nor did they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
maintain an awful silence during the repast. On
the contrary, Mr. Ducksmith loved to talk&mdash;in a
dismal, pompous way&mdash;chiefly of British politics.
His method of discourse was to place himself in
the position of those in authority and to declare
what he would do in any given circumstances.
Now, unless the interlocutor adopts the same
method and declares what <em>he</em> would do, conversation
is apt to become one-sided. Aristide, having
no notion of a policy should he find himself exercising
the functions of the British Chancellor of the
Exchequer, cheerfully tried to change the ground
of debate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you do, Mr. Ducksmith, if you
were King of England?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should try to rule the realm like a Christian
statesman,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ducksmith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have a devil of a time!&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; said Mr. Ducksmith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have a&mdash;ah, I see&mdash;<em>pardon</em>. I
should&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He looked from one paralyzing face
to the other, and threw out his arms. &ldquo;<em>Parbleu!</em>&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I should decapitate your Mrs. Grundy,
and make it compulsory for bishops to dance once
a week in Trafalgar Square. <em>Tiens!</em> I would have
it a capital offence for any English cook to prepare
hashed mutton without a license, and I would banish
all the bakers of the kingdom to Siberia&mdash;ah!
your English bread, which you have to eat stale
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
so as to avoid a horrible death!&mdash;and I would open
two hundred thousand <em>caf&eacute;s</em>&mdash;<em>mon Dieu!</em> how
thirsty I have been there!&mdash;and I would make
every English work-girl do her hair properly, and
I would ordain that everybody should laugh three
times a day, under pain of imprisonment for life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, Mr. Pujol,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Ducksmith,
seriously, &ldquo;you would not be acting as a constitutional
monarch. There is such a thing as the
British Constitution, which foreigners are bound
to admire, even though they may not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be a king must be a great responsibility,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Ducksmith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;you have uttered a
profound truth.&rdquo; And to himself he murmured,
though he should not have done so, &ldquo;<em>Nom de Dieu!
Nom de Dieu de nom de Dieu!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>After lunch they drove to Versailles, which they
inspected in the same apathetic fashion; then they
returned to the hotel, where they established themselves
for the rest of the day in the airless salon,
Mr. Ducksmith reading English newspapers and
his wife knitting a grey woollen sock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon vieux!</em>&rdquo; said Aristide to Bocardon, &ldquo;they
are people of a nightmare. They are automata endowed
with the faculty of digestion. <em>Ce sont des
gens invraisemblables.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paris providing them, apparently, with no entertainment,
they started, after a couple of days,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
<em>Aristide duce et auspice Pujol</em>, on their railway tour
through France, to Aristide a pilgrimage of unimaginable
depression. They began with Chartres,
continued with the Ch&acirc;teaux of the Loire, and began
to work their way south. Nothing that Aristide
could do roused them from their apathy. They
were exasperatingly docile, made few complaints,
got up, entrained, detrained, fed, excursioned, slept,
just as they were bidden. But they looked at nothing,
enjoyed nothing (save perhaps English newspapers
and knitting), and uttered nothing by way
of criticism or appreciation when Aristide attempted
to review the wonders through which they
had passed. They did not care to know the history,
authentic or Pujolic, of any place they visited; they
were impressed by no scene of grandeur, no corner
of exquisite beauty. To go on and on, in a dull,
non-sentient way, so long as they were spared all
forethought, all trouble, all afterthought, seemed to
be their ideal of travel. Sometimes Aristide, after
a fruitless effort to capture their interest, would
hold his head, wondering whether he or the Ducksmith
couple were insane. It was a dragon-fly personally
conducting two moles through a rose-garden.</p>

<p>Once only, during the early part of their journey,
did a gleam of joyousness pierce the dull
glaze of Mr. Ducksmith&#8217;s eyes. He had procured
from the bookstall of a station a pile of English
newspapers, and was reading them in the train,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
while his wife knitted the interminable sock. Suddenly
he folded a <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, and handed it
over to Aristide so that he should see nothing but a
half-page advertisement. The great capitals leaped
to Aristide&#8217;s eyes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
&ldquo;DUCKSMITH&#8217;S DELICATE JAMS.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am <em>the</em> Ducksmith,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I started and
built up the business. When I found that I could
retire, I turned it into a limited liability company,
and now I am free and rich and able to enjoy the
advantages of foreign travel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ducksmith started, sighed, and dropped a
stitch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you also make pickles?&rdquo; asked Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did manufacture pickles, but I made my name
in jam. In the trade you will find it an honoured
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is that in every nursery in Europe,&rdquo; Aristide
declared, with polite hyperbole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have done my best to deserve my reputation,&rdquo;
said Mr. Ducksmith, as impervious to flattery as to
impressions of beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>P&eacute;ca&iuml;re!</em>&rdquo; said Aristide to himself, &ldquo;how can I
galvanize these corpses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the soulless days went by this problem grew
to be Aristide&#8217;s main solicitude. He felt strangled,
choked, borne down by an intolerable weight.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
What could he do to stir their vitality? Should he
fire off pistols behind them, just to see them jump?
But would they jump? Would not Mr. Ducksmith
merely turn his rabbit-eyes, set in their bloodhound
sockets, vacantly on him, and assume that the detonations
were part of the tour&#8217;s programme?
Could he not fill him up with conflicting alcohols,
and see what inebriety would do for him? But
Mr. Ducksmith declined insidious potations. He
drank only at meal-times, and sparingly. Aristide
prayed that some Tha&iuml;s might come along, cast her
spell upon him, and induce him to wink. He himself
was powerless. His raciest stories fell on dull
ears; none of his jokes called forth a smile. At
last, having taken them to nearly all the historic
ch&acirc;teaux of Touraine, without eliciting one cry of
admiration, he gave Mr. Ducksmith up in despair
and devoted his attention to the lady.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ducksmith parted her smooth black hair in
the middle and fastened it in a knob at the back of
her head. Her clothes were good and new, but
some desolate dressmaker had contrived to invest
them with an air of hopeless dowdiness. At her
bosom she wore a great brooch, containing intertwined
locks of a grandfather and grandmother
long since defunct. Her mind was as drearily
equipped as her person. She had a vague idea that
they were travelling in France; but if Aristide had
told her that it was Japan she would have meekly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
accepted the information. She had no opinions.
Still she was a woman, and Aristide, firm in his
conviction that when it comes to love-making all
women are the same, proceeded forthwith to make
love to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he, one morning&mdash;she was knitting
in the vestibule of the H&ocirc;tel du Faisan at
Tours, Mr. Ducksmith being engaged, as usual, in
the salon with his newspapers&mdash;&ldquo;how much more
charming that beautiful grey dress would be if it
had a spot of colour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His audacious hand placed a deep crimson rose
against her corsage, and he stood away at arm&#8217;s
length, his head on one side, judging the effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magnificent! If madame would only do me
the honour to wear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ducksmith took the flower hesitatingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m afraid my husband does not like colour,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be taught,&rdquo; cried Aristide. &ldquo;You
must teach him. I must teach him. Let us begin
at once. Here is a pin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held the pin delicately between finger and
thumb, and controlled her with his roguish eyes.
She took the pin and fixed the rose to her dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know what Mr. Ducksmith will say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What he ought to say, madame, is &lsquo;Bountiful
Providence, I thank Thee for giving me such a
beautiful wife.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Mrs. Ducksmith blushed and, to conceal her face,
bent it over her resumed knitting. She made
woman&#8217;s time-honoured response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think you ought to say such things, Mr.
Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madame,&rdquo; said he, lowering his voice; &ldquo;I
have tried not to; but, <em>que voulez-vous</em>, it was
stronger than I. When I see you going about like
a little grey mouse&rdquo;&mdash;the lady weighed at least
twelve stone&mdash;&ldquo;you, who ought to be ravishing the
eyes of mankind, I feel indignation here&rdquo;&mdash;he
thumped his chest; &ldquo;my Proven&ccedil;al heart is stirred.
It is enough to make one weep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t quite understand you, Mr. Pujol,&rdquo; she
said, dropping stitches recklessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madame,&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;and the rascal&#8217;s
whisper on such occasions could be very seductive&mdash;&ldquo;that
I will never believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am too old to dress myself up in fine clothes,&rdquo;
she murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s an illusion,&rdquo; said he, with a wide-flung
gesture, &ldquo;that will vanish at the first experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ducksmith emerged from the salon, <em>Daily
Telegraph</em> in hand. Mrs. Ducksmith shot a timid
glance at him and the knitting needles clicked together
nervously. But the vacant eyes of the heavy
man seemed no more to note the rose on her bosom
than they noted any point of beauty in landscape or
building.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Aristide went away chuckling, highly diverted
by the success of his first effort. He had touched
some hidden springs of feeling. Whatever might
happen, at any rate, for the remainder of the tour
he would not have to spend his emotional force in
vain attempts to knock sparks out of a jelly-fish.
He noticed with delight that at dinner that evening
Mrs. Ducksmith, still wearing the rose, had modified
the rigid sweep of her hair from the mid-parting.
It gave just a wavy hint of coquetry. He
made her a little bow and whispered, &ldquo;Charming!&rdquo;
Whereupon she coloured and dropped her eyes.
And during the meal, while Mr. Ducksmith discoursed
on bounty-fed sugar, his wife and Aristide
exchanged, across the table, the glances
of conspirators. After dinner he approached
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame, may I have the privilege of showing
you the moon of Touraine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laid down her knitting. &ldquo;Bartholomew,
will you come out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her over his glasses and shook his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the good of looking at moonshine?
The moon itself I have already seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Aristide and Mrs. Ducksmith sat by themselves
outside the hotel, and he expounded to her
the beauty of moonlight and its intoxicating effect
on folks in love.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
&ldquo;Wouldn&#8217;t you like,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to be lying on
that white burnished cloud with your beloved kissing
your feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What odd things you think of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But wouldn&#8217;t you?&rdquo; he insinuated.</p>

<p>Her bosom heaved and swelled on a sigh. She
watched the strip of silver for a while and then
murmured a wistful &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell you of many odd things,&rdquo; said Aristide.
&ldquo;I can tell you how flowers sing and what
colour there is in the notes of birds. And how a
cornfield laughs, and how the face of a woman
who loves can outdazzle the sun. <em>Ch&egrave;re madame</em>,&rdquo;
he went on, after a pause, touching her little plump
hand, &ldquo;you have been hungering for beauty and
thirsting for sympathy all your life. Isn&#8217;t that
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have always been misunderstood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tear fell. Our rascal saw the glistening drop
with peculiar satisfaction. Poor Mrs. Ducksmith!
It was a child&#8217;s game. <em>Enfin</em>, what woman could
resist him? He had, however, one transitory
qualm of conscience, for, with all his vagaries,
Aristide was a kindly and honest man. Was it
right to disturb those placid depths? Was it right
to fill this woman with romantic aspirations that
could never be gratified? He himself had not the
slightest intention of playing Lothario and of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
wrecking the peace of the Ducksmith household.
The realization of the saint-like purity of his aims
reassured him. When he wanted to make love to a
woman, <em>pour tout de bon</em>, it would not be to Mrs.
Ducksmith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;I am doing a noble
and disinterested act. I am restoring sight to the
blind. I am giving life to one in a state of suspended
animation. <em>Tron de l&#8217;Air!</em> I am playing
the part of a soul-reviver! And, <em>parbleu!</em> it isn&#8217;t
Jean or Jacques that can do that. It takes an Aristide
Pujol!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, having persuaded himself, in his Southern
way, that he was executing an almost divine mission,
he continued, with a zest now sharpened by
an approving conscience, to revive Mrs. Ducksmith&#8217;s
soul.</p>

<p>The poor lady, who had suffered the blighting
influence of Mr. Ducksmith for twenty years with
never a ray of counteracting warmth from the outside,
expanded like a flower to the sun under the
soul-reviving process. Day by day she exhibited
some fresh timid coquetry in dress and manner.
Gradually she began to respond to Aristide&#8217;s suggestions
of beauty in natural scenery and exquisite
building. On the ramparts of Angoul&ecirc;me, daintiest
of towns in France, she gazed at the smiling
valleys of the Charente and the Son stretching
away below, and of her own accord touched his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
arm lightly and said: &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; She appealed
to her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Once more (it had become a habit) she exchanged
glances with Aristide. He drew her a little farther
along, under pretext of pointing out the dreamy
sweep of the Charente.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he appreciates nothing at all, why on earth
does he travel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyelids fluttered upwards for a fraction of
a second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s his mania,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He can never rest
at home. He must always be going on&mdash;on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you endure it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She sighed. &ldquo;It is better now that you can
teach me how to look at things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; thought Aristide. &ldquo;When I leave them
she can teach him to look at things and revive his
soul. Truly I deserve a halo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Mr. Ducksmith appeared to be entirely unperceptive
of his wife&#8217;s spiritual expansion, Aristide
grew bolder in his apostolate. He complimented
Mrs. Ducksmith to his face. He presented
her daily with flowers. He scarcely waited for
the heavy man&#8217;s back to be turned to make love to
her. If she did not believe that she was the most
beautiful, the most ravishing, the most delicate-souled
woman in the world, it was through no fault
of Aristide. Mr. Ducksmith went his pompous,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
unseeing way. At every stopping-place stacks of
English daily papers awaited him. Sometimes,
while Aristide was showing them the sights of a
town&mdash;to which, by the way, he insisted on being
conducted&mdash;he would extract a newspaper from his
pocket and read with dull and dogged stupidity.
Once Aristide caught him reading the advertisements
for cooks and housemaids. In these circumstances
Mrs. Ducksmith spiritually expanded at an
alarming rate; and, correspondingly, dwindled the
progress of Mr. Ducksmith&#8217;s sock.</p>

<p>They arrived at Perigueux, in Perigord, land of
truffles, one morning, in time for lunch. Towards
the end of the meal the <em>ma&icirc;tre d&#8217;h&ocirc;tel</em> helped them
to great slabs of <em>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras</em>, made in the
house&mdash;most of the hotel-keepers in Perigord make
<em>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras</em>, both for home consumption and
for exportation&mdash;and waited expectant of their appreciation.
He was not disappointed. Mr. Ducksmith,
after a hesitating glance at the first mouthful,
swallowed it, greedily devoured his slab, and,
after pointing to his empty plate, said, solemnly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Plou.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like Oliver, he asked for more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tiens!</em>&rdquo; thought Aristide, astounded. &ldquo;Is he,
too, developing a soul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, alas! there were no signs of it when they
went their dreary round of the town in the usual
ramshackle open cab. The cathedral of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Saint-Front, extolled by Aristide and restored by Abadie&mdash;a
terrible fellow who has capped with tops of pepper-castors
every pre-Gothic building in France&mdash;gave
him no thrill; nor did the picturesque, tumble-down
ancient buildings on the banks of the Dordogne,
nor the delicate Renaissance fa&ccedil;ades in the
cool, narrow Rue du Lys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will now go back to the hotel,&rdquo; said Mr.
Ducksmith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But have we seen it all?&rdquo; asked his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will go back to the hotel,&rdquo; repeated her
husband, in his expressionless tones. &ldquo;I have seen
enough of Perigueux.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was final. They drove back to the hotel.
Mr. Ducksmith, without a word, went straight into
the salon, leaving Aristide and his wife standing in
the vestibule.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, madame,&rdquo; said Aristide; &ldquo;are you
going to sacrifice the glory of God&#8217;s sunshine to
the manufacture of woollen socks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled&mdash;she had caught the trick at last&mdash;and
said, in happy submission: &ldquo;What would you
have me do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one hand he clasped her arm; with the
other, in a superb gesture, he indicated the sunlit
world outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us drain together,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;the loveliness
of Perigueux to its dregs!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Greatly daring, she followed him. It was a
rapturous escapade&mdash;the first adventure of her life.
She turned her comely face to him and he saw
smiles round her lips and laughter in her eyes.
Aristide, worker of miracles, strutted by her side
choke-full of vanity. They wandered through the
picturesque streets of the old town with the gaiety
of truant children, peeping through iron gateways
into old courtyards, venturing their heads into the
murk of black stairways, talking (on the part
of Aristide) with mothers who nursed chuckling
babes on their doorsteps, crossing the thresholds,
hitherto taboo, of churches, and meeting the mystery
of coloured glass and shadows and the heavy
smell of incense.</p>

<p>Her hand was on his arm when they entered the
flagged courtyard of an ancient palace, a stately
medley of the centuries, with wrought ironwork in
the balconies, tourelles, oriels, exquisite Renaissance
ornaments on architraves, and a great central
Gothic doorway, with great window-openings
above, through which was visible the stone staircase
of honour leading to the upper floors. In a corner
stood a medi&aelig;val well, the sides curiously carved.
One side of the courtyard blazed in sunshine, the
other lay cool and grey in shadow. Not a human
form or voice troubled the serenity of the spot. On
a stone bench against the shady wall Aristide and
Mrs. Ducksmith sat down to rest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>Voil&agrave;!</em>&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;Here one can suck in
all the past like an omelette. They had the feeling
for beauty, those old fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have wasted twenty years of my life,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Ducksmith, with a sigh. &ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t I meet
someone like you when I was young? Ah, you
don&#8217;t know what my life has been, Mr. Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not Aristide when we are alone? Why
not, Henriette?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He too had the sense of adventure, and his eyes
were more than usually compelling and his voice
more seductive. For some reason or other, undivined
by Aristide&mdash;over-excitement of nerves,
perhaps&mdash;she burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Henriette! Henriette, ne pleurez pas.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>His arm crept round her&mdash;he knew not how; her
head sank on his shoulder, she knew not why&mdash;faithlessness
to her lord was as far from her
thoughts as murder or arson; but for one poor
little moment in a lifetime it is good to weep on
someone&#8217;s shoulder and to have someone&#8217;s sympathetic
arm around one&#8217;s waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Pauvre petite femme!</em> And is it love she is
pining for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sobbed; he lifted her chin with his free hand&mdash;and
what less could mortal apostle do?&mdash;he kissed
her on her wet cheek.</p>

<p>A bellow like that of an angry bull caused them
to start asunder. They looked up, and there was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Mr. Ducksmith within a few yards of them, his
face aflame, his rabbit&#8217;s eyes on fire with rage. He
advanced, shook his fists in their faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve caught you! At last, after twenty years,
I&#8217;ve caught you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; cried Aristide, starting up, &ldquo;allow
me to explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He swept Aristide aside like an intercepting
willow-branch, and poured forth a torrent of
furious speech upon his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have hated you for twenty years. Day by
day I have hated you more. I&#8217;ve watched you,
watched you, watched you! But, you sly jade,
you&#8217;ve been too clever for me till now. Yes; I
followed you from the hotel. I dogged you. I
foresaw what would happen. Now the end has
come. I&#8217;ve hated you for twenty years&mdash;ever since
you first betrayed me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ducksmith, who had sat with overwhelmed
head in her hands, started bolt upright, and looked
at him like one thunderstruck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I betrayed you?&rdquo; she gasped, in bewilderment.
&ldquo;My God! When? How? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed&mdash;for the first time since Aristide had
known him&mdash;but it was a ghastly laugh, that made
the jowls of his cheeks spread horribly to his ears;
and again he flooded the calm, stately courtyard
with the raging violence of words. The veneer of
easy life fell from him. He became the low-born,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
petty tradesman, using the language of the hands
of his jam factory. No, he had never told her.
He had awaited his chance. Now he had found it.
He called her names....</p>

<a name="img274" id="img274"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 461px;">
<img src="images/img274.jpg" width="461" height="600" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;i&#8217;ve caught you! at last, after twenty years,<br />
i&#8217;ve caught you!&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Aristide interposed, his Southern being athrob
with the insults heaped upon the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say that again, monsieur,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;and I
will take you up in my arms like a sheep and
throw you down that well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men glared at one another, Aristide
standing bent, with crooked fingers, ready to spring
at the other&#8217;s throat. The woman threw herself
between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&#8217;s sake,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;listen to me!
I have done no wrong. I have done no wrong now&mdash;I
never did you wrong, so help me God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ducksmith laughed again, and his laugh re-echoed
round the quiet walls and up the vast staircase
of honour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;d be a fool not to say it. But now I&#8217;ve
done with you. Here, you, sir. Take her away&mdash;do
what you like with her; I&#8217;ll divorce her. I&#8217;ll
give you a thousand pounds never to see her
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Goujat! Triple goujat!</em>&rdquo; cried Aristide, more
incensed than ever at this final insult.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ducksmith, deadly white, swayed sideways,
and Aristide caught her in his arms and dragged
her to the stone bench. The fat, heavy man looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
at them for a second, laughed again, and sped
through the <em>porte-coch&egrave;re</em>. Mrs. Ducksmith quickly
recovered from her fainting attack, and gently
pushed the solicitous Aristide away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heaven!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;What is
to become of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last person to answer the question was
Aristide. For once in his adventurous life resource
failed him. He stared at the woman for
whom he cared not the snap of a finger, and who,
he knew, cared not the snap of a finger for him,
aghast at the havoc he had wrought. If he had
set out to arouse emotion in these two sluggish
breasts he had done so with a vengeance. He had
thought he was amusing himself with a toy cannon,
and he had fired a charge of dynamite.</p>

<p>He questioned her almost stupidly&mdash;for a man
in the comic mask does not readily attune himself
to tragedy. She answered with the desolate frankness
of a lost soul. And then the whole meaning&mdash;or
the lack of meaning&mdash;of their inanimate lives
was revealed to him. Absolute estrangement had
followed the birth of their child nearly twenty years
ago. The child had died after a few weeks. Since
then he saw&mdash;and the generous blood of his heart
froze as the vision came to him&mdash;that the vulgar,
half-sentient, rabbit-eyed bloodhound of a man
had nursed an unexpressed, dull, implacable resentment
against the woman. It did not matter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
that the man&#8217;s suspicion was vain. To Aristide
the woman&#8217;s blank amazement at the preposterous
charge was proof enough; to the man the
thing was real. For nearly twenty years the man
had suffered the cancer to eat away his vitals, and
he had watched and watched his blameless wife,
until now, at last, he had caught her in this folly.
No wonder he could not rest at home; no wonder
he was driven, Io-wise, on and on, although he
hated travel and all its discomforts, knew no word
of a foreign language, knew no scrap of history,
had no sense of beauty, was utterly ignorant, as
every single one of our expensively State-educated
English lower classes is, of everything that matters
on God&#8217;s earth; no wonder that, in the unfamiliarity
of foreign lands, feeling as helpless as a ballet-dancer
in a cavalry charge, he looked to Cook, or
Lunn, or the Agence Pujol to carry him through
his uninspired pilgrimage. For twenty years he
had shown no sign of joy or sorrow or anger,
scarcely even of pleasure or annoyance. A tortoise
could not have been more unemotional. The unsuspected
volcano had slumbered. To-day came
disastrous eruption. And what was a mere laughing,
crying child of a man like Aristide Pujol in
front of a Ducksmith volcano?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to become of me?&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Ducksmith
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ma foi!</em>&rdquo; said Aristide, with a shrug of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
shoulders. &ldquo;What&#8217;s going to become of anyone?
Who can foretell what will happen in a minute&#8217;s
time? <em>Tiens!</em>&rdquo; he added, kindly laying his hand
on the sobbing woman&#8217;s shoulder. &ldquo;Be comforted,
my poor Henriette. Just as nothing in this world
is as good as we hope, so nothing is as bad as we
fear. <em>Voyons!</em> All is not lost yet. We must return
to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She weepingly acquiesced. They walked through
the quiet streets like children whose truancy had
been discovered and who were creeping back to
condign punishment at school. When they reached
the hotel, Mrs. Ducksmith went straight up to the
woman&#8217;s haven, her bedroom.</p>

<p>Aristide tugged at his Vandyke beard in dire
perplexity. The situation was too pregnant with
tragedy for him to run away and leave the pair to
deal with it as best they could. But what was he
to do? He sat down in the vestibule and tried to
think. The landlord, an unstoppable gramophone
of garrulity, entering by the street-door and bearing
down upon him, put him to flight. He, too,
sought his bedroom, a cool apartment with a balcony
outside the French window. On this balcony,
which stretched along the whole range of
first-floor bedrooms, he stood for a while, pondering
deeply. Then, in an absent way, he overstepped the
limit of his own room-frontage. A queer sound
startled him. He paused, glanced through the open
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
window, and there he saw a sight which for the
moment paralyzed him.</p>

<a name="img280" id="img280"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/img280.jpg" width="334" height="600" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">there he saw a sight which for the moment paralyzed him</span>
</div>

<p>Recovering command of his muscles, he tiptoed
his way back. He remembered now that the three
rooms adjoined. Next to his was Mr. Ducksmith&#8217;s,
and then came Mrs. Ducksmith&#8217;s. It was Mr. Ducksmith
whom he had seen. Suddenly his dark face
became luminous with laughter, his eyes glowed, he
threw his hat in the air and danced with glee about
the room. Having thus worked off the first intoxication
of his idea, he flung his few articles of
attire and toilet necessaries into his bag, strapped
it, and darted, in his dragon-fly way, into the corridor
and tapped softly at Mrs. Ducksmith&#8217;s
door. She opened it. He put his finger to
his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he whispered, bringing to bear on
her all the mocking magnetism of his eyes, &ldquo;if you
value your happiness you will do exactly what I
tell you. You will obey me implicitly. You must
not ask questions. Pack your trunks at once. In
ten minutes&#8217; time the porter will come for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with a scared face. &ldquo;But
what am I going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to revenge yourself on your
husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&#8217;t want to,&rdquo; she replied, piteously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Begin, <em>ch&egrave;re madame</em>. Every
moment is precious.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
In a state of stupefied terror the poor woman
obeyed him. He saw her start seriously on her task
and then went downstairs, where he held a violent
and gesticulatory conversation with the landlord
and with a man in a green baize apron summoned
from some dim lair of the hotel. After that he
lit a cigarette and smoked feverishly, walking up
and down the pavement. In ten minutes&#8217; time his
luggage with that of Mrs. Ducksmith was placed
upon the cab. Mrs. Ducksmith appeared trembling
and tear-stained in the vestibule.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The man in the green baize apron knocked at
Mr. Ducksmith&#8217;s door and entered the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come for the baggage of monsieur,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baggage? What baggage?&rdquo; asked Mr. Ducksmith,
sitting up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have descended the baggage of Monsieur Pujol,&rdquo;
said the porter in his stumbling English, &ldquo;and
of madame, and put them in a cab, and I naturally
thought monsieur was going away, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going away!&rdquo; He rubbed his eyes, glared at
the porter, and dashed into his wife&#8217;s room. It
was empty. He dashed into Aristide&#8217;s room. It
was empty, too. Shrieking inarticulate anathema,
he rushed downstairs, the man in the green baize
apron following at his heels.</p>

<p>Not a soul was in the vestibule. No cab was at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the door. Mr. Ducksmith turned upon his stupefied
satellite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must have gone already. I filled the
cab. Perhaps Monsieur Pujol and madame have
gone before to make arrangements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have they gone to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Perigueux there is nowhere to go to with
baggage but the railway station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A decrepit vehicle with a gaudy linen canopy
hove in sight. Mr. Ducksmith hailed it
as the last victims of the Flood must have
hailed the Ark. He sprang into it and drove to
the station.</p>

<p>There, in the <em>salle d&#8217;attente</em>, he found Aristide
mounting guard over his wife&#8217;s luggage. He hurled
his immense bulk at his betrayer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You blackguard! Where is my wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Aristide, puffing a cigarette,
sublimely impudent and debonair, &ldquo;I decline to answer
any questions. Your wife is no longer your
wife. You offered me a thousand pounds to take
her away. I am taking her away. I did not deign
to disturb you for such a trifle as a thousand
pounds, but, since you are here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled engagingly and held out his curved
palm. Mr. Ducksmith foamed at the corners of the
small mouth that disappeared into the bloodhound
jowls.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
&ldquo;My wife!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;If you don&#8217;t want
me to throw you down and trample on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A band of loungers, railway officials, peasants,
and other travellers awaiting their trains, gathered
round. As the altercation was conducted in English,
which they did not understand, they could only
hope for the commencement of physical hostilities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;I do not understand
you. For twenty years you hold an innocent
and virtuous woman under an infamous suspicion.
She meets a sympathetic soul, and you come across
her pouring into his ear the love and despair of a
lifetime. You have more suspicion. You tell me
you will give me a thousand pounds to go away
with her. I take you at your word. And now you
want to stamp on me. <em>Ma foi!</em> it is not reasonable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ducksmith seized him by the lapels of his
coat. A gasp of expectation went round the crowd.
But Aristide recognized an agonized appeal in the
eyes now bloodshot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife!&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;I want my wife.
I can&#8217;t live without her. Give her back to me.
Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better search the station,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>The heavy man unconsciously shook him in his
powerful grasp, as a child might shake a doll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her to me! Give her to me, I say! She
won&#8217;t regret it.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
&ldquo;You swear that?&rdquo; asked Aristide, with lightning
quickness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear it, by God! Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide disengaged himself, waved his hand
airily towards Perigueux, and smiled blandly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the salon of the hotel, waiting for you to
prostrate yourself on your knees before her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ducksmith gripped him by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back with me. If you&#8217;re lying I&#8217;ll kill
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The luggage?&rdquo; queried Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound the luggage!&rdquo; said Mr. Ducksmith,
and dragged him out of the station.</p>

<p>A cab brought them quickly to the hotel. Mr.
Ducksmith bolted like an obese rabbit into the salon.
A few moments afterwards Aristide, entering,
found them locked in each other&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>They started alone for England that night, and
Aristide returned to the directorship of the Agence
Pujol. But he took upon himself enormous credit
for having worked a miracle.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;One thing I can&#8217;t understand,&rdquo; said I, after he
had told me the story, &ldquo;is what put this sham
elopement into your crazy head. What did you see
when you looked into Mr. Ducksmith&#8217;s bedroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, <em>mon vieux</em>, I did not tell you. If
I had told you, you would not have been
surprised at what I did. I saw a sight that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
would have melted the heart of a stone. I
saw Ducksmith wallowing on his bed and sobbing
as if his heart would break. It filled my soul with
pity. I said: &lsquo;If that mountain of insensibility can
weep and sob in such agony, it is because he loves&mdash;and
it is I, Aristide, who have reawakened that
love.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why on earth didn&#8217;t you go and
fetch Mrs. Ducksmith and leave them together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started from his chair and threw up both
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu!</em>&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;You English! You are
a charming people, but you have no romance. You
have no dramatic sense. I will help myself to a
whisky and soda.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE ADVENTURE OF THE FICKLE GODDESS</strong></p>


<p>It may be remembered that Aristide Pujol had
aged parents, browned and wrinkled children
of the soil, who had passed all their days in
the desolation of Aigues-Mortes, the little fortified,
derelict city in the salt marshes of Provence. Although
they regarded him with the same unimaginative
wonder as a pair of alligators might regard
an Argus butterfly, their undoubted but
freakish progeny, and although Aristide soared high
above their heads in all phases of thought and emotion,
the mutual ties remained strong and perdurable.
Scarcely a year passed without Aristide
struggling somehow south to visit <em>ses vieux</em>, as he
affectionately called them, and whenever Fortune
shed a few smiles on him, one or two at least were
sure to find their way to Aigues-Mortes in the shape
of, say, a silver-mounted umbrella for his father or
a deuce of a Paris hat for the old lady&#8217;s Sunday
wear. Monsieur and Madame Pujol had a sacred
museum of these unused objects&mdash;the pride of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
lives. Aristide was entirely incomprehensible, but
he was a good son. A bad son in France is rare.</p>

<p>But once Aristide nearly killed his old people
outright. An envelope from him contained two
large caressive slips of bluish paper, which when
scrutinized with starting eyes turned out to be two
one-thousand-franc notes. Mon Dieu! What had
happened? Had Aristide been robbing the Bank
of France? They stood paralyzed and only recovered
motive force when a neighbour suggested
their reading the accompanying letter. It did not
explain things very clearly. He was in Aix-les-Bains,
a place which they had never heard of, making
his fortune. He was staying at the H&ocirc;tel de
l&#8217;Europe, where Queen Victoria (they had heard
of Queen Victoria) had been contented to reside,
he was a glittering figure in a splendid beau-monde,
and if <em>ses vieux</em> would buy a few cakes and a bottle
of vin cachet&eacute; with the enclosed trifle, to celebrate
his prosperity, he would deem it the privilege of a
devoted son. But Pujol senior, though wondering
where the devil he had fished all that money from,
did not waste it in profligate revelry. He took the
eighty pounds to the bank and exchanged the perishable
paper for one hundred solid golden louis
which he carried home in a bag curiously bulging
beneath his woollen jersey and secreted it with the
savings of his long life in the mattress of the conjugal
bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
&ldquo;If only he hasn&#8217;t stolen it,&rdquo; sighed the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it matter, since it is sewn up there
all secure?&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;No one can
find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Proven&ccedil;al peasant is as hard-headed and
practical as a Scottish miner, and if left alone by
the fairies would produce no imaginative effect
whatever upon his generation; but in his progeniture
he is more preposterously afflicted with changelings
than any of his fellows the world over, which,
though ethnologically an entirely new proposition,
accounts for a singular number of things and <em>inter
alia</em> for my dragon-fly friend, Aristide Pujol.</p>

<p>Now, Aristide, be it said at the outset, had not
stolen the money. It (and a vast amount more)
had been honestly come by. He did not lie when
he said that he was staying at the H&ocirc;tel de l&#8217;Europe,
Aix-les-Bains, honoured by the late Queen Victoria
(pedantic accuracy requires the correction that
the august lady rented the annexe, the Villa Victoria,
on the other side of the shady way&mdash;but no
matter&mdash;an hotel and its annexe are the same
thing) nor did he lie in boasting of his prodigious
prosperity. Aristide was in clover. For the first,
and up to now as I write, the only, time in his life
he realized the gorgeous visions of pallid years.
He was leading the existence of the amazing rich.
He could drink champagne&mdash;not your miserable
<em>tisane</em> at five francs a quart&mdash;but real champagne,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
with year of vintage and <em>g&ocirc;ut am&eacute;rican</em> or <em>g&ocirc;ut
anglais</em> marked on label, fabulously priced; he
could dine lavishly at the Casino restaurants or at
Nikola&#8217;s, prince of restaurateurs, among the opulent
and the fair; he could clothe himself in attractive
raiment; he could step into a fiacre and bid the
man drive and not care whither he went or what
he paid; he could also distribute five-franc pieces
to lame beggars. He scattered his money abroad
with both hands, according to his expansive temperament;
and why not, when he was drawing
wealth out of an inexhaustible fount? The process
was so simple, so sure. All you had to do was
to believe in the cards on which you staked your
money. If you knew you were going to win, you
won. Nothing could be easier.</p>

<p>He had drifted into Aix-les-Bains from Geneva on
the lamentable determination of a commission agency
in the matter of some patent fuel, with a couple of
louis in his pocket forlornly jingling the tale of his
entire fortune. As this was before the days when
you had to exhibit certificates of baptism, marriage,
sanity and bank-balance before being allowed to
enter the baccarat rooms, Aristide paid his two
francs and made a bee line for the tables. I am
afraid Aristide was a gambler. He was never so
happy as when taking chances; his whole life was a
gamble, with Providence holding the bank. Before
the night was over he had converted his two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
louis into fifty. The next day they became five
hundred. By the end of a week his garments were
wadded with bank notes whose value amounted to
a sum so stupendous as to be beyond need of computation.
He was a celebrity in the place and
people nudged each other as he passed by. And
Aristide passed by with a swagger, his head high
and the end of his pointed beard sticking joyously
up in the air.</p>

<p>We see him one August morning, in the plentitude
of his success, lounging in a wicker chair on
the shady lawn of the H&ocirc;tel de l&#8217;Europe. He wore
white buckskin shoes&mdash;I begin with these as they
were the first point of his person to attract the
notice of the onlooker&mdash;lilac silk socks, a white
flannel suit with a zig-zag black stripe, a violet tie
secured by a sapphire and diamond pin, and a rakish
panama hat. On his knees lay the <em>Matin</em>; the fingers
of his left hand held a fragrant corona; his
right hand was uplifted in a gesture, for he was
talking. He was talking to a couple of ladies who
sat near by, one a mild-looking Englishwoman of
fifty, dressed in black, the other, her daughter, a
beautiful girl of twenty-four. That Aristide should
fly to feminine charms, like moth to candle, was a
law of his being; that he should lie, with shriveled
wings, at Miss Errington&#8217;s feet was the obvious result.
Her charms were of the winsome kind to
which he was most susceptible. She had an oval
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
face, a little mouth like crumpled rose petals (so
Aristide himself described it), a complexion the
mingling of ivory and peach blossom (Aristide
again), a straight little nose, appealing eyes of the
deepest blue veiled by sweeping lashes and fascinating
fluffiness of dark hair over a pure brow.
She had a graceful figure, and the slender foot below
her white piqu&eacute; skirt was at once the envy and
admiration of Aix-les-Bains.</p>

<p>Aristide talked. The ladies listened, with obvious
amusement. In the easy hotel way he had
fallen into their acquaintance. As the man of
wealth, the careless player who took five-hundred-louis
banks at the table with the five-louis minimum,
and cleared out the punt, he felt it necessary to explain
himself. I am afraid he deviated from the
narrow path of truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What perfect English you speak,&rdquo; Miss Errington
remarked, when he had finished his harangue
and had put the corona between his lips. Her
voice was a soft contralto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have mixed much in English society, since I
was a child,&rdquo; replied Aristide, in his grandest
manner. &ldquo;Fortune has made me know many
of your county families and members of Parliament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Errington laughed. &ldquo;Our M. P.&#8217;s are rather
a mixed lot, Monsieur Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To me an English Member of Parliament is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
high-bred conservative. I do not recognize the
others,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately we have to recognize them,&rdquo; said
the elder lady with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not socially, madame. They exist as mechanical
factors of the legislative machine; but that is
all.&rdquo; He swelled as if the blood of the Montmorencys
and the Colignys boiled in his veins. &ldquo;We
do not ask them into our drawing rooms. We do
not allow them to marry our daughters. We only
salute them with cold politeness when we pass them
in the street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s astonishing,&rdquo; said Miss Errington, &ldquo;how
strongly the aristocratic principle exists in republican
France. Now, there&#8217;s our friend, the Comte de
Lussigny, for instance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A frown momentarily darkened the cloudless
brow of Aristide Pujol. He did not like the
Comte de Lussigny&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With Monsieur de Lussigny,&rdquo; he interposed, &ldquo;it
is a matter of prejudice, not of principle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reasoned philosophy of a lifetime, mademoiselle,&rdquo;
answered Aristide. He turned to Mrs.
Errington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you known Monsieur de Lussigny,
madame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at her daughter. &ldquo;It was in Monte
Carlo the winter before last, wasn&#8217;t it, Betty?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Since then we have met him frequently in England
and Paris. We came across him, just lately, at
Trouville. I think he&#8217;s charming, don&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s a great gambler,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>Betty Errington laughed again. &ldquo;But so are
you. So is mamma. So am I, in my poor little
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We gamble for amusement,&rdquo; said Aristide
loftily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t,&rdquo; cried Miss Betty, with merry
eyes&mdash;and she looked adorable&mdash;&ldquo;When I put my
despised five-franc piece down on the table I want
desperately to win, and when the horrid croupier
rakes it up I want to hit him&mdash;Oh! I want to hit
him hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when you win?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t think of the croupier at all,&rdquo;
said Miss Betty.</p>

<p>Her mother smiled indulgently and exchanged a
glance with Aristide. This pleased him; there was
an agreeable little touch of intimacy in it. It confirmed
friendly relations with the mother. What
were his designs as regards the daughter he did not
know. They were not evil, certainly. For all his
southern blood, Latin traditions and devil-may-care
upbringing, Aristide, though perhaps not reaching
our divinely set and therefore unique English standard
of morality, was a decent soul; further, partly
through his pedagogic sojourn among them, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
partly through his childish adoration of the frank,
fair-cheeked, northern goddesses talking the quick,
clear speech, who passed him by when he was a
hunted little devil of a <em>chasseur</em> in the Marseilles
caf&eacute;, he had acquired a peculiarly imaginative reverence
for English girls. The reverence, indeed,
extended to English ladies generally. Owing to
the queer circumstances of his life they were the
only women of a class above his own, with whom
he had associated on terms of equality. He had,
then, no dishonorable designs as regards Miss Betty
Errington. On the other hand, the thoughts of
marriage had as yet not entered his head. You
see, a Frenchman and an Englishman or an American,
view marriage from entirely different angles.
The Anglo-Saxon of honest instincts, attracted towards
a pretty girl at once thinks of the possibilities
of marriage; if he finds them infinitely remote,
he makes romantic love to her in the solitude of his
walks abroad or of his sleepless nights, and, in
her presence, is as dumb and dismal as a freshly
hooked trout. The equally honest Gaul does
nothing of the kind. The attraction in itself
is a stimulus to adventure. He makes love to her,
just because it is the nature of a lusty son of Adam
to make love to a pretty daughter of Eve. He lives
in the present. The rest doesn&#8217;t matter. He leaves
it to chance. I am speaking, be it understood, not
of deep passions&mdash;that is a different matter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
altogether&mdash;but of the more superficial sexual attractions
which we, as a race, take so seriously and
puritanically, often to our most disastrous undoing,
and which the Latin light-heartedly regards as
essential, but transient phenomena of human existence.
Aristide made the most respectful love in
the world to Betty Errington, because he could not
help himself. &ldquo;<em>Tonnerre de Dieu!</em>&rdquo; he cried when
from my Britannic point of view, I talked to him
on the subject. &ldquo;You English whom I try to understand
and can never understand are so funny!
It would have been insulting to Miss Betty Errington&mdash;<em>tiens!</em>&mdash;a
purple hyacinth of spring&mdash;that was
what she was&mdash;not to have made love to her. Love
to a pretty woman is like a shower of rain to hyacinths.
It passes, it goes. Another one comes.
<em>Qu&#8217;importe?</em> But the shower is necessary&mdash;Ah!
<em>sacr&eacute; gredin</em>, when will you comprehend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this to make as clear as an Englishman, in
the confidence of a changeling child of Provence
can hope to do, the attitude of Aristide Pujol towards
the sweet and innocent Betty Errington with
her mouth like crumpled rose-petals, her ivory and
peach-blossom complexion, her soft contralto voice,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, as per foregoing bald
description, and as per what can, by imaginative
effort, be pictured from the Pujolic hyperbole, by
which I, the unimportant narrator of these chronicles,
was dazzled and overwhelmed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t think of the croupier at all,&rdquo;
said Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think of no one who brings you good
fortune?&rdquo; asked Aristide. He threw the <em>Matin</em> on
the grass, and, doubling himself up in his chair
regarded her earnestly. &ldquo;Last night you put five
louis into my bank&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I won forty. I could have hugged
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t you? Ah!&rdquo; His arms spread wide
and high. &ldquo;What I have lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Errington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, Madame,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;that is the despair
of our artificial civilization. It prohibits so
much spontaneous expression of emotion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll forgive me, Monsieur Pujol,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Errington dryly, &ldquo;but I think our artificial civilization
has its advantages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will forgive me, in your turn,&rdquo; said Aristide,
&ldquo;I see a doubtful one advancing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man approached the group and with profuse
gestures took off a straw hat which he thrust under
his right arm, exposing an amazingly flat head on
which the closely cropped hair stood brush-fashion
upright. He had an insignificant pale face to
which a specious individuality was given by a moustache
with ends waxed up to the eyes and by a
monocle with a tortoise shell rim. He was dressed
(his valet had misjudged things&mdash;and valets like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the rest of us are fallible) in what was yesterday a
fairly white flannel suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame&mdash;Mademoiselle.&rdquo; He shook hands with
charming grace. &ldquo;Monsieur.&rdquo; He bowed stiffly.
Aristide doffed his Panama hat with adequate
ceremony. &ldquo;May I be permitted to join you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, Monsieur de Lussigny,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Errington.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Lussigny brought up a chair and
sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time did you get to bed, last night?&rdquo;
asked Betty Errington. She spoke excellently pure
French, and so did her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon after we parted, mademoiselle, quite early
for me but late for you. And you look this morning
as if you had gone to bed at sundown and got
up at dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Betty&#8217;s glance responsive to the compliment
filled Aristide with wrath. What right had the
Comte de Lussigny, a fellow who consorted with
Brazilian Rastaquou&egrave;res and perfumed Levantine
nondescripts, to win such a glance from Betty Errington?</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Mademoiselle can look so fresh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in
the artificial atmosphere of Aix, what is there of
adorable that she must not resemble in the innocence
of her Somersetshire home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot imagine it, Monsieur,&rdquo; said the
Count; &ldquo;but I have had the privilege to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
&ldquo;I hope Monsieur Pujol will visit us also in our
country home, when we get back,&rdquo; said Mrs. Errington
with intent to pacificate. &ldquo;It is modest,
but it is old-world and has been in our family for
hundreds of years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, these old English homes!&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you care to hear about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>He drew his chair courteously a foot or so
nearer that of the mild lady; Monsieur de
Lussigny took instant advantage of the move
to establish himself close to Miss Betty. Aristide
turned one ear politely to Mrs. Errington&#8217;s
discourse, the other ragingly and impotently to the
whispered conversation between the detached
pair.</p>

<p>Presently a novel fell from the lady&#8217;s lap. Aristide
sprang to his feet and restored it. He remained
standing. Mrs. Errington consulted a
watch. It was nearing lunch time. She rose, too.
Aristide took her a pace or two aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Errington,&rdquo; said he, in English.
&ldquo;I do not wish to be indiscreet&mdash;but you come from
your quiet home in Somerset and your beautiful
daughter is so young and inexperienced, and I am
a man of the world who has mingled in all the
society of Europe&mdash;may I warn you against admitting
the Comte de Lussigny too far into your intimacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
She turned an anxious face. &ldquo;Monsieur Pujol,
is there anything against the Count?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide executed the large and expressive shrug
of the Southerner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I play high at the tables for my amusement&mdash;I
know the principal players, people of high standing.
Among them Monsieur de Lussigny&#8217;s reputation
is not spotless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You alarm me very much,&rdquo; said Mrs. Errington,
troubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only put you on your guard,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>The others who had risen and followed, caught
them up. At the entrance to the hotel the ladies
left the men elaborately saluting. The latter, alone,
looked at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each man raised his hat, turned on his heel and
went his way. Aristide betook himself to the caf&eacute;
on the Place Carnot on the side of the square facing
the white Etablissement des Bains, with a stern
sense of having done his duty. It was monstrous
that this English damask rose should fall a prey to
so detestable a person as the Comte de Lussigny.
He suspected him of disgraceful things. If only he
had proof. Fortune, ever favoring him, stood at
his elbow. She guided him straight to a table in
the front row of the terrace where sat a black-haired,
hard-featured though comely youth deep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
in thought, in front of an untouched glass of beer.
At Aristide&#8217;s approach he raised his head, smiled,
nodded and said: &ldquo;Good morning, sir. Will you
join me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide graciously accepted the invitation and
sat down. The young man was another hotel acquaintance,
one Eugene Miller of Atlanta, Georgia,
a curious compound of shrewdness and simplicity,
to whom Aristide had taken a fancy. He was
twenty-eight and ran a colossal boot-factory in
partnership with another youth and had a consuming
passion for stained-glass windows. From books
he knew every square foot of old stained-glass in
Europe. But he had crossed the Atlantic for the
first time only six weeks before, and having indulged
his craving immoderately, had rested for a
span at Aix-les-Bains to recover from &aelig;sthetic indigestion.
He had found these amenities agreeable
to his ingenuous age. He had also, quite recently,
come across the Comte de Lussigny. Hence
the depth of thought in which Aristide discovered
him. Now, the fact that North is North and South
is South and that never these twain shall meet is
a proposition all too little considered. One of these
days when I can retire from the dull but exacting
avocation of tea-broking in the City, I think I shall
write a newspaper article on the subject. Anyhow,
I hold the theory that the Northerners of all nations
have a common characteristic and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Southerners of all nations have a common characteristic,
and that it is this common characteristic in each
case that makes North seek and understand North
and South seek and understand South. I will not
go further into the general proposition; but as a
particular instance I will state that the American
of the South and the Frenchman of the South
found themselves in essential sympathy. Eugene
Miller had the unfearing frankness of Aristide
Pujol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used rather to look down upon Europe as a
place where people knew nothing at all,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;We&#8217;re sort of trained to think it&#8217;s an extinct volcano,
but it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s alive. My God! It&#8217;s alive.
It&#8217;s Hell in the shape of a Limburger cheese. I
wish the whole population of Atlanta, Georgia,
would come over and just see. There&#8217;s a lot to be
learned. I thought I knew how to take care of
myself, but this tortoise-shell-eyed Count taught me
last night that I couldn&#8217;t. He cleaned me out of
twenty-five hundred dollars&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Aristide, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ecart&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide brought his hand down with a bang on
the table and uttered anathemas in French and
Proven&ccedil;al entirely unintelligible to Eugene Miller;
but the youth knew by instinct that they were
useful, soul-destroying curses and he felt comforted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ecart&eacute;! You played ecart&eacute; with Lussigny?
But my dear young friend, do you know anything
of ecart&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Miller. &ldquo;I used to play it as
a child with my sisters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know the <em>jeux de r&egrave;gle</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The formal laws of the game&mdash;the rules of discards&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never heard of them,&rdquo; said Eugene Miller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are as absolute as the Code Napol&eacute;on,&rdquo;
cried Aristide. &ldquo;You can&#8217;t play without knowing
them. You might as well play chess without knowing
the moves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t help it,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&#8217;t play ecart&eacute; any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; said Miller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Comment?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must. I&#8217;ve fixed it up to get my revenge
this afternoon&mdash;in my sitting room at the hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&#8217;s imbecile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sweep of Aristide&#8217;s arm produced prismatic
chaos among a tray-full of drinks which the waiter
was bringing to the family party at the next table.
&ldquo;It&#8217;s imbecile,&rdquo; he cried, as soon as order was
apologetically and pecuniarily restored. &ldquo;You are
a little mutton going to have its wool taken
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve fixed it up,&rdquo; said Miller. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve never gone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
back on an engagement yet in my own country
and I&#8217;m not going to begin this side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide argued. He argued during the mechanical
absorption of four glasses of <em>vermouth-cassis</em>&mdash;after
which prodigious quantity of black
currant syrup he rose and took the Gadarene youth
to Nikola&#8217;s where he continued the argument during
d&eacute;jeuner. Eugene Miller&#8217;s sole concession was that
Aristide should be present at the encounter and,
backing his hand, should have the power (given by
the rules of the French game) to guide his play.
Aristide agreed and crammed his young friend
with the <em>jeux de r&egrave;gle</em> and <em>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie gras</em>.</p>

<p>The Count looked rather black when he found
Aristide Pujol in Miller&#8217;s sitting room. He could
not, however, refuse him admittance to the game.
The three sat down, Aristide by Miller&#8217;s side, so
that he could overlook the hand and, by pointing,
indicate the cards that it was advisable to play.
The game began. Fortune favored Mr. Eugene
Miller. The Count&#8217;s brow grew blacker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are bringing your own luck to our friend,
Monsieur Pujol,&rdquo; said he, dealing the cards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He needs it,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Le roi</em>,&rdquo; said the Count, turning up the king.</p>

<p>The Count won the vole, or all five tricks, and
swept the stakes towards him. Then, fortune
quickly and firmly deserted Mr. Miller. The Count
besides being an amazingly fine player, held
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
amazingly fine hands. The pile of folded notes in front
of him rose higher and higher. Aristide tugged at
his beard in agitation. Suddenly, as the Count
dealt a king as trump card, he sprang to his feet
knocking over the chair behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cheat, monsieur. You cheat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; cried the outraged dealer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been palming kings and neutralizing the
cut. I&#8217;ve been watching. Now I catch him,&rdquo; cried
Aristide in great excitement. &ldquo;<em>Ah, sale voleur!
Maintenant je vous tiens!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the Comte de Lussigny with
dignity, stuffing his winnings into his jacket pocket.
&ldquo;You insult me. It is an infamy. Two of my
friends will call upon you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Monsieur Miller and I will kick them over
Mont Revard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot treat <em>gens d&#8217;honneur</em> in such a way,
monsieur.&rdquo; He turned to Miller, and said haughtily
in his imperfect English, &ldquo;Did you see the cheat,
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t say that I did,&rdquo; replied the young man.
&ldquo;On the other hand that torch-light procession of
kings doesn&#8217;t seem exactly natural.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did not see anything! <em>Bon!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I saw. Isn&#8217;t that enough, <em>hein</em>?&rdquo; shouted
Aristide brandishing his fingers in the Count&#8217;s face.
&ldquo;You come here and think there&#8217;s nothing easier
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
than to cheat young foreigners who don&#8217;t know the
rules of ecart&eacute;. You come here and think you can
carry off rich young English misses. Ah, <em>sale
escroc!</em> You never thought you would have to
reckon with Aristide Pujol. You call yourself
the Comte de Lussigny. Bah! I know you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
he didn&#8217;t, but that doesn&#8217;t matter&mdash;&ldquo;your <em>dossier</em>
is in the hands of the prefect of Police. I am
going to get that <em>dossier</em>. Monsieur Lepine is my
intimate friend. Every autumn we shoot together.
Aha! You send me your two galley-birds and see
what I do to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Comte de Lussigny twirled the tips of his
moustache almost to his forehead and caught up his
hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friends shall be officers in the uniform of
the French Army,&rdquo; he said, by the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mine shall be two gendarmes,&rdquo; retorted
Aristide. &ldquo;<em>Nom de Dieu!</em>&rdquo; he cried, after the
other had left the room. &ldquo;We let him take the
money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s of no consequence. He didn&#8217;t get away
with much anyway,&rdquo; said young Miller. &ldquo;But
he would have if you hadn&#8217;t been here. If ever
I can do you a return service, just ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide went out to look for the Erringtons.
But they were not to be found. It was only late
in the afternoon that he met Mrs. Errington in the
hall of the hotel. He dragged her into a corner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and in his impulsive fashion told her everything.
She listened white faced, in great distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughter&#8217;s engaged to him. I&#8217;ve only just
learned,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Engaged? <em>Sacrebleu!</em> Ah, <em>le goujat!</em>&rdquo;&mdash;for
the second he was desperately, furiously, jealously
in love with Betty Errington. &ldquo;<em>Ah, le sale type!
Voyons!</em> This engagement must be broken off.
At once! You are her mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will hear of nothing against him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will tell her this. It will be a blow;
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Errington twisted a handkerchief between
helpless fingers. &ldquo;Betty is infatuated. She won&#8217;t
believe it.&rdquo; She regarded him piteously. &ldquo;Oh,
Monsieur Pujol, what can I do? You see she has
an independent fortune and is over twenty-one. I
am powerless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will meet his two friends,&rdquo; exclaimed Aristide
magnificently&mdash;&ldquo;and I will kill him. <em>Voil&agrave;!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a duel? No! How awful!&rdquo; cried the mild
lady horror-stricken.</p>

<p>He thrust his cane dramatically through a sheet
of a newspaper, which he had caught up from a
table. &ldquo;I will run him through the body like that&rdquo;&mdash;Aristide
had never handled a foil in his life&mdash;&ldquo;and
when he is dead, your beautiful daughter will
thank me for having saved her from such an execrable
fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
&ldquo;But you mustn&#8217;t fight. It would be too dreadful.
Is there no other way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must consult first with your daughter,&rdquo;
said Aristide.</p>

<p>He dined in the hotel with Eugene Miller. Neither
the Erringtons nor the Comte de Lussigny
were anywhere to be seen. After dinner, however,
he found the elder lady waiting for him in the hall.
They walked out into the quiet of the garden. She
had been too upset to dine, she explained, having
had a terrible scene with Betty. Nothing but absolute
proofs of her lover&#8217;s iniquity would satisfy her.
The world was full of slanderous tongues; the
noblest and purest did not escape. For herself, she
had never been comfortable with the Comte de Lussigny.
She had noticed too that he had always
avoided the best French people in hotels. She
would give anything to save her daughter. She
wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the unhappy girl has written him compromising
letters,&rdquo; she lamented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be got back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how? Oh, Monsieur Pujol, do you think
he would take money for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A scoundrel like that would take money for his
dead mother&#8217;s shroud,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand pounds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked very haggard and helpless beneath
the blue arc-lights. Aristide&#8217;s heart went out to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
her. He knew her type&mdash;the sweet gentlewoman
of rural England who comes abroad to give her
pretty daughter a sight of life, ingenuously confident
that foreign watering-places are as innocent
as her own sequestered village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is much money, <em>ch&egrave;re madame</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am fairly well off,&rdquo; said Mrs. Errington.</p>

<p>Aristide reflected. At the offer of a smaller sum
the Count would possibly bluff. But to a Knight
of Industry, as he knew the Count to be, a certain
thousand pounds would be a great temptation. And
after all to a wealthy Englishwoman what was a
thousand pounds?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you offer him a thousand
pounds for the letters, and a written confession
that he is not the Comte de Lussigny, but a common
adventurer, I stake my reputation that he will
accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked along for a few moments in silence;
the opera had begun at the adjoining Villa des
Fleurs and the strains floated through the still August
air. After a while she halted and laid her
hand on his sleeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Pujol, I have never been faced with
such a thing, before. Will you undertake for me
this delicate and difficult business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my life is at the service
of yourself and your most exquisite daughter.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
She pressed his hand. &ldquo;Thank God, I&#8217;ve got a
friend in this dreadful place,&rdquo; she said brokenly.
&ldquo;Let me go in.&rdquo; And when they reached the
lounge, she said, &ldquo;Wait for me here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She entered the lift. Aristide waited. Presently
the lift descended and she emerged with a slip of
paper in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a bearer cheque, Monsieur Pujol, for
a thousand pounds. Get the letters and the confession
if you can, and a mother&#8217;s blessing will go
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She left him and went upstairs again in the lift.
Aristide athirst with love, living drama and unholy
hatred of the Comte de Lussigny, cocked his black,
soft-felt evening hat at an engaging angle on his
head and swaggered into the Villa des Fleurs. As
he passed the plebeian crowd round the petits-chevaux
table&mdash;these were the days of little horses
and not the modern equivalent of <em>la boule</em>&mdash;he
threw a louis on the square marked 5, waited for
the croupier to push him his winnings, seven louis
and his stake on the little white horse, and walked
into the baccarat room. A bank was being called
for thirty louis at the end table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Quarante</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ajug&eacute; &agrave; quarante louis</em>,&rdquo; cried the croupier, no
one bidding higher.</p>

<p>Aristide took the banker&#8217;s seat and put down his
forty louis. Looking round the long table he saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the Comte de Lussigny sitting in the punt. The
two men glared at each other defiantly. Someone
went &ldquo;banco.&rdquo; Aristide won. The fact of his
holding the bank attracted a crowd round the table.
The regular game began. Aristide won, lost, won
again. Now it must be explained, without going
into the details of the game, that the hand against
the bank is played by the members of the punt in
turn.</p>

<p>Suddenly, before dealing the cards, Aristide
asked, &ldquo;<em>A qui la main?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>C&#8217;est &agrave; Monsieur</em>,&rdquo; said the croupier, indicating
Lussigny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Il y a une suite</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide, signifying, as
was his right, that he would retire from the bank
with his winnings. &ldquo;The face of that gentleman
does not please me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a hush at the humming table. The
Count grew dead white and looked at his fingernails.
Aristide superbly gathered up his notes and
gold, and tossing a couple of louis to the croupiers,
left the table, followed by all eyes. It was one
of the thrilling moments of Aristide&#8217;s life. He had
taken the stage, commanded the situation. He had
publicly offered the Comte de Lussigny the most
deadly insult and the Comte de Lussigny sat down
beneath it like a lamb. He swaggered slowly
through the crowded room, twirling his moustache,
and went into the cool of the moonlit deserted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
garden beyond, where he waited gleefully. He
had a puckish knowledge of human nature. After
a decent interval, and during the absorbing interest
of the newly constituted bank, the Comte de Lussigny
slipped unnoticed from the table and went in
search of Aristide. He found him smoking a large
corona and lounging in one wicker chair with his
feet on another, beside a very large whisky and
soda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&#8217;s you,&rdquo; said he without moving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Count furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t yet had the pleasure of kicking your
friends over Mont Revard,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, <em>mon petit</em>, this has got to finish,&rdquo;
cried the Count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Parfaitement.</em> I should like nothing better than
to finish. But let us finish like well-bred people,&rdquo;
said Aristide suavely. &ldquo;We don&#8217;t want the whole
Casino as witnesses. You&#8217;ll find a chair over there.
Bring it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was enjoying himself immensely. The Count
glared at him, turned and banged a chair over by
the side of the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you insult me like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve talked by telephone
this evening with my good friend Monsieur
Lepine, Prefect of Police of Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; said the Count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Vous verrez.</em> In the meantime, perhaps we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
might have a little conversation. Will you have a
whisky and soda? It is one of my English habits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Count emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You permit me then?&rdquo; He drank a great
draught. &ldquo;You are wrong. It helps to cool one&#8217;s
temper. <em>Eh bien</em>, let us talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He talked. He put before the Count the situation
of the beautiful Miss Errington. He conducted
the scene like the friend of the family whose
astuteness he had admired as a boy in the melodramas
that found their way to Marseilles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said he, at last, having vainly offered
from one hundred to eight hundred pounds for poor
Betty Errington&#8217;s compromising letters. &ldquo;Look&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He drew the cheque from his note-case.
&ldquo;Here are twenty-five thousand francs. The signature
is that of the charming Madame Errington
herself. The letters, and a little signed word, just
a little word. &lsquo;Mademoiselle, I am a <em>chevalier d&#8217;industrie</em>.
I have a wife and five children. I am not
worthy of you. I give you back your promise.&rsquo;
Just that. And twenty-five thousand francs, <em>mon
ami</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never in life!&rdquo; exclaimed the Count rising.
&ldquo;You continue to insult me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide for the first time abandoned his lazy
and insolent attitude and jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&#8217;ll continue to insult you, <em>canaille</em> that
you are, all through that room,&rdquo; he cried, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
a swift-flung gesture towards the brilliant doorway.
&ldquo;You are dealing with Aristide Pujol. Will
you never understand? The letters and a confession
for twenty-five thousand francs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never in life,&rdquo; said the Count, and he moved
swiftly away.</p>

<p>Aristide caught him by the collar as he stood on
the covered terrace, a foot or two from the
threshold of the gaming-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear to you, I&#8217;ll make a scandal that you
won&#8217;t survive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Count stopped and pushed Aristide&#8217;s hand
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit nothing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you are a gambler
and so am I. I will play you for those documents
against twenty-five thousand francs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Aristide, staggered for the moment.</p>

<p>The Comte de Lussigny repeated his proposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Bon</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;<em>Tr&eacute;s bon. C&#8217;est entendu.
C&#8217;est fait.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Beelzebub had arisen and offered to play
beggar-my-neighbour for his soul, Aristide would
have agreed; especially after the large whisky and
soda and the Mumm Cordon Rouge and the Napoleon
brandy which Eugene Miller had insisted on
his drinking at dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a large room at the hotel,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will join you,&rdquo; said the Count. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
he took off his hat very politely. &ldquo;Go first. I
will be there in three minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide trod on air during the two minutes&#8217; walk
to the H&ocirc;tel de l&#8217;Europe. At the bureau he ordered
a couple of packs of cards and a supply of
drinks and went to his palatial room on the ground
floor. In a few moments the Comte de Lussigny
appeared. Aristide offered him a two francs corona
which was ceremoniously accepted. Then he tore
the wrapping off one of the packs of cards and
shuffled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, still shuffling. &ldquo;I should
like to deal two hands at ecart&eacute;. It signifies nothing.
It is an experiment. Will you cut?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Volontiers</em>,&rdquo; said the Count.</p>

<p>Aristide took up the pack, dealt three cards to
the Count, three cards to himself, two cards to the
Count, two to himself and turned up the King of
Hearts as the eleventh card.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;expose your hand and I
will expose mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both men threw their hands face uppermost on
the table. Aristide&#8217;s was full of trumps, the Count&#8217;s
of valueless cards.</p>

<p>He looked at his adversary with his roguish, triumphant
smile. The Count looked at him darkly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ordinary card player does not know how
to deal like that,&rdquo; he said with sinister significance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am not ordinary in anything, my dear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
sir,&rdquo; laughed Aristide, in his large boastfulness.
&ldquo;If I were, do you think I would have agreed to
your absurd proposal? <em>Voyons</em>, I only wanted to
show you that in dealing cards I am your equal.
Now, the letters&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The Count threw a small
packet on the table. &ldquo;You will permit me? I do
not wish to read them. I verify only. Good,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;And the confession?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you like,&rdquo; said the Count, coldly. Aristide
scribbled a few lines that would have been
devastating to the character of a Hyrcanean tiger
and handed the paper and fountain pen to the
Count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you sign?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Count glanced at the words and signed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Voil&agrave;</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide, laying Mrs. Errington&#8217;s
cheque beside the documents. &ldquo;Now let us play.
The best of three games?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Count. &ldquo;But you will excuse
me, monsieur, if I claim to play for ready money.
The cheque will take five days to negotiate and if
I lose, I shall evidently have to leave Aix to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s reasonable,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>He drew out his fat note-case and counted
twenty-five one-thousand-franc notes on to the table.
And then began the most exciting game of
cards he had ever played. In the first place he was
playing with another person&#8217;s money for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
fantastic stake, a girl&#8217;s honour and happiness. Secondly
he was pitted against a master of ecart&eacute;.
And thirdly he knew that his adversary would cheat
if he could and that his adversary suspected him of
fraudulent designs. So as they played, each man
craned his head forward and looked at the other
man&#8217;s fingers with fierce intensity.</p>

<p>Aristide lost the first game. He wiped the sweat
from his forehead. In the second game, he won
the vole in one hand. The third and final game began.
They played slowly, carefully, with keen
quick eyes. Their breathing came hard. The
Count&#8217;s lips parted beneath his uptwisted moustache
showed his teeth like a cat&#8217;s. Aristide lost
sense of all outer things in the thrill of the encounter.
They snarled the stereotyped phrases necessary
for the conduct of the game. At last the
points stood at four for Aristide and three for his
adversary. It was Aristide&#8217;s deal. Before turning
up the eleventh card he paused for the fraction of
a second. If it was the King, he had won. He
flicked it neatly face upward. It was not the King.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;J&#8217;en donne.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Non. Le roi.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The Count played and marked the King. Aristide
had no trumps. The game was lost.</p>

<p>He sat back white, while the Count smiling gathered
up the bank-notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Monsieur Pujol,&rdquo; said he impudently,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am willing to sell you this rubbish for the
cheque.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide jumped to his feet. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he cried.
Madness seized him. Regardless of the fact that
he had nothing like another thousand pounds left
wherewith to repay Mrs. Errington if he lost, he
shouted: &ldquo;I will play again for it. Not ecart&eacute;.
One cut of the cards. Ace lowest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin, you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide watched his hand like cat, as he cut.
He cut an eight. Aristide gave a little gasp of
joy and cut quickly. He held up a Knave and
laughed aloud. Then he stopped short as he saw
the Count about to pounce on the documents and
the cheque. He made a swift movement and
grabbed them first, the other man&#8217;s hand on his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Canaille!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dashed his free hand into the adventurer&#8217;s
face. The man staggered back. Aristide pocketed
the precious papers. The Count scowled at him for
an undecided second, and then bolted from the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Aristide, sinking into his chair
and wiping his face. &ldquo;That was a narrow escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. It was only ten o&#8217;clock.
It had seemed as if his game with Lussigny had
lasted for hours. He could not go to bed and
stood confronted with anti-climax. After a while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
he went in search of Eugene Miller and having
found him in solitary meditation on stained glass
windows in the dim-lit grounds of the Villa,
sat down by his side and for the rest of the
evening poured his peculiar knowledge of Europe
into the listening ear of the young man
from Atlanta.</p>

<p>On the following morning, as soon as he was
dressed, he learned from the Concierge that the
Comte de Lussigny had left for Paris by the early
train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>A little later Mrs. Errington met him in the
lounge and accompanied him to the lawn where
they had sat the day before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no words to thank you, Monsieur Pujol,&rdquo;
she said with tears in her eyes. &ldquo;I have heard how
you shamed him at the tables. It was brave of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was nothing.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders
as if he were in the habit of doing deeds like that
every day of his life. &ldquo;And your exquisite daughter,
Madame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Betty! She is prostrate. She says she
will never hold up her head again. Her heart is
broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is young and will be mended,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>She smiled sadly. &ldquo;It will be a question of time.
But she is grateful to you, Monsieur Pujol. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
realizes from what a terrible fate you have saved
her.&rdquo; She sighed. There was a brief silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;a further stay in
Aix would be too painful. We have decided to
take the Savoy express this evening and get back
to our quiet home in Somerset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madame,&rdquo; said Aristide earnestly. &ldquo;And
shall I not have the pleasure of seeing the charming
Miss Betty again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will come and stay with us in September.
Let me see? The fifteenth. Why not fix a date?
You have my address? No? Will you write it
down?&rdquo; she dictated: &ldquo;Wrotesly Manor, Burnholme,
Somerset. There I&#8217;ll try to show you how
grateful I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She extended her hand. He bowed over it and
kissed it in his French way and departed a very
happy man.</p>

<p>The Erringtons left that evening. Aristide waylaid
them as they were entering the hotel omnibus,
with a preposterous bouquet of flowers which he
presented to Betty, whose pretty face was hidden
by a motor-veil. He bowed, laid his hand on his
heart and said: &ldquo;<em>Adieu, mademoiselle.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, but most graciously,
&ldquo;<em>Au revoir</em>, Monsieur Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the next few days Aix seemed to be tame
and colourless. In an inexplicable fashion, too, it
had become unprofitable. Aristide no longer knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
that he was going to win; and he did not win. He
lost considerably. So much so that on the morning
when he was to draw the cash for the cheque,
at the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, he had only fifty pounds
and some odd silver left. Aristide looking at the
remainder rather ruefully made a great resolution.
He would gamble no more. Already he was richer
than he had ever been in his life. He would leave
Aix. <em>Tiens!</em> why should he not go to his good
friends the Bocardons at N&icirc;mes, bringing with him
a gold chain for Bocardon and a pair of ear-rings
for the adorable Zette? There he would look about
him. He would use the thousand pounds as a stepping-stone
to legitimate fortune. Then he would
visit the Erringtons in England, and if the beautiful
Miss Betty smiled on him&mdash;why, after all, <em>sacrebleu</em>
he was an honest man, without a feather on
his conscience.</p>

<p>So, jauntily swinging his cane, he marched into
the office of the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, went into the
inner room and explained his business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, your cheque, monsieur, that we were to collect.
I am sorry. It has come back from the London
bankers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has not been honoured. See, monsieur. &lsquo;Not
known. No account.&rsquo;&rdquo; The cashier pointed to the
grim words across the cheque.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Comprends pas</em>,&rdquo; faltered Aristide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
&ldquo;It means that the person who gave you the
cheque has no account at this bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide took the cheque and looked at it in a
dazed way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I do not get my twenty-five thousand
francs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently not,&rdquo; said the cashier.</p>

<p>Aristide stood for a while stunned. What did
it mean? His thousand pounds could not be lost.
It was impossible. There was some mistake. It
was an evil dream. With a heavy weight on the
top of his head, he went out of the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais
and mechanically crossed the little street separating
the Bank from the caf&eacute; on the Place Carnot.
There he sat stupidly and wondered. The
waiter hovered in front of him. &ldquo;<em>Monsieur d&eacute;sire?</em>&rdquo;
Aristide waved him away absently. Yes,
it was some mistake. Mrs. Errington in her agitation
must have used the wrong cheque book. But
even rich English people do not carry about with
them a circulating library assortment of cheque
books. It was incomprehensible&mdash;and meanwhile,
his thousand pounds....</p>

<p>The little square blazed before him in the August
sunshine. Opposite flashed the white mass of the
Etablissement des Bains. There was the old Roman
Arch of Titus, gray and venerable. There were
the trees of the gardens in riotous greenery. There
on the right marking the hour of eleven on its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
black face was the clock of the Comptoir National.
It was Aix; familiar Aix; not a land of dreams.
And there coming rapidly across from the Comptoir
National was the well knit figure of the young man
from Atlanta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Nom de Dieu</em>,&rdquo; murmured Aristide. &ldquo;<em>Nom de
Dieu de nom de Dieu!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eugene Miller, in a fine frenzy, threw himself
into a chair beside Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here. Can you understand this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thrust into his hand a pink strip of paper.
It was a cheque for a hundred pounds, made payable
to Eugene Miller, Esquire, signed by Mary Errington,
and marked &ldquo;Not known. No account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tonnerre de Dieu!</em>&rdquo; cried Aristide. &ldquo;How did
you get this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did I get it? I cashed it for her&mdash;the day
she went away. She said urgent affairs summoned
her from Aix&mdash;no time to wire for funds&mdash;wanted
to pay her hotel bill&mdash;and she gave me the address
of her old English home in Somerset and invited
me to come there in September. Fifteenth of September.
Said that you were coming. And now
I&#8217;ve got a bum cheque. I guess I can&#8217;t wander
about this country alone. I need blinkers and harness
and a man with a whip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on indignantly. Aristide composed his
face into an expression of parental interest; but
within him there was shivering and sickening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
upheaval. He saw it all, the whole mocking drama....</p>

<p>He, Aristide Pujol, was the most sweetly, the
most completely swindled man in France.</p>

<p>The Comte de Lussigny, the mild Mrs.
Errington and the beautiful Betty were in league
together and had exquisitely plotted. They had
conspired, as soon as he had accused the Count
of cheating. The rascal must have gone straight
to them from Miller&#8217;s room. No wonder that Lussigny,
when insulted at the tables, had sat like a
tame rabbit and had sought him in the garden. No
wonder he had accepted the accusation of adventurer.
No wonder he had refused to play for the
cheque which he knew to be valueless. But why,
thought Aristide, did he not at once consent to sell
the papers on the stipulation that he should be paid
in notes? Aristide found an answer. He wanted
to get everything for nothing, afraid of the use
that Aristide might make of a damning confession,
and also relying for success on his manipulation of
the cards. Finally he had desired to get hold of a
dangerous cheque. In that he had been foiled.
But the trio has got away with his thousand
pounds, his wonderful thousand pounds. He reflected,
still keeping an attentive eye on young Eugene
Miller and interjecting a sympathetic word,
that after he had paid his hotel bill, he would be
as poor on quitting Aix-les-Bains as he was when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
he had entered it. <em>Sic transit</em>.... As it was
in the beginning with Aristide Pujol, is now and
ever shall be....</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have my clothes&mdash;such clothes as I&#8217;ve
never had in my life,&rdquo; thought Aristide. &ldquo;And a
diamond and sapphire tie-pin and a gold watch, and
all sorts of other things. <em>Tron de l&#8217;air</em>, I&#8217;m still
rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who would have thought she was like that?&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;And a hundred pounds, too. A lot of
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For nothing in the world would he have confessed
himself a fellow-victim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t care a cent for the hundred pounds,&rdquo;
cried the young man. &ldquo;Our factory turns out seven
hundred and sixty-seven million pairs of boots per
annum.&rdquo; (Aristide, not I, is responsible for the
statistics.) &ldquo;But I have a feeling that in this
hoary country I&#8217;m just a little toddling child. And
I hate it. I do, sir. I want a nurse to take me
round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide flashed the lightning of his wit upon
the young man from Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do, my dear young friend. I&#8217;ll be your
nurse, at a weekly salary&mdash;say a hundred francs&mdash;it
doesn&#8217;t matter. We will not quarrel.&rdquo; Eugene
Miller was startled. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aristide, with a
convincing flourish. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll clear robbers and sirens
and harpies from your path. I&#8217;ll show you things
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
in Europe&mdash;from Troms&ouml; to Cap Spartivento that
you never dreamed of. I&#8217;ll lead you to every
stained glass window in the world. I know them
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I particularly want to see those in the church of
St. Sebald in Nuremberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know them like my pocket,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;I
will take you there. We start to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Pujol,&rdquo; said the somewhat bewildered
Georgian. &ldquo;I thought you were a man of fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am more than a man. I am a soldier. I am
a soldier of Fortune. The fickle goddess has for
the moment deserted me. But I am loyal. I have
for all worldly goods, two hundred and fifty dollars,
with which I shall honorably pay my hotel
bill. I say I am a soldier of Fortune. But,&rdquo; he
slapped his chest, &ldquo;I am the only honorable one on
the Continent of Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man fixed upon him the hard blue
eyes, not of the enthusiast for stained glass windows,
but of the senior partner in the boot factory
of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It&#8217;s a deal. Shake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Aristide, after having shaken
hands, &ldquo;come and lunch with me at Nikola&#8217;s for
the last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose, stretched out both arms in a wide gesture
and smiled with his irresistible Ancient Mariner&#8217;s
eyes at the young man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
&ldquo;We lunch. We eat ambrosia. Then we go out
together and see the wonderful world through the
glass-blood of saints and martyrs and apostles and
the good Father Abraham and Louis Quatorze.
<em>Viens, mon cher ami.</em> It is the dream of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Practically penniless and absolutely disillusioned,
the amazing man was radiantly happy.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>THE ADVENTURE OF A SAINT MARTIN&#8217;S SUMMER</strong></p>


<p>My good friend Blessington, who is a mighty
man in the Bordeaux wine-trade, happening
one day to lament the irreparable loss
of a deceased employ&eacute;, an Admirable Crichton of
a myriad accomplishments and linguistic attainments
whose functions it had been, apparently, to travel
about between London, Bordeaux, Marseilles and
Algiers, I immediately thought of a certain living
and presumably unemployed paragon of my acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the very man you&#8217;re looking for,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s a kind of human firework,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
his name is Aristide Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sketched the man&mdash;in my desire to do a good
turn to Aristide, perhaps in exaggerated colour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me have a look at him,&rdquo; said Blessington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may be anywhere on the continent of
Europe,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;How long can you give me to
produce him?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
&ldquo;A week. Not longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll do my best,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>By good luck my telegram, sent off about four
o&#8217;clock, found him at 213 <em>bis</em> Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;.
He had just returned to Paris after some mad dash
for fortune (he told me afterwards a wild and disastrous
story of a Russian Grand-Duke, a Dancer
and a gold mine in the Dolomites) and had once
more resumed the dreary conduct of the Agence
Pujol at the H&ocirc;tel du Soleil et de l&#8217;Ecosse. My
summons being imperative, he abandoned the
Agence Pujol as a cat jumps off a wall, and,
leaving the guests of the Hotel guideless, to
the indignation of Monsieur Bocardon, whom he
had served this trick several times before, paid his
good landlady, Madam Bidoux, what he owed her,
took a third-class ticket to London, bought, lunatic
that he was, a ripe Brie cheese, a foot in diameter,
a present to myself, which he carried in his hand
most of the journey, and turned up at my house at
eight o&#8217;clock the next morning with absolutely
empty pockets and the happiest and most fascinating
smile that ever irradiated the face of man. As a
matter of fact, he burst his way past my scandalized
valet into my bedroom and woke me up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am, my dear friend, and here is something
French you love that I have brought you,&rdquo;
and he thrust the Brie cheese under my nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
If you were awakened by a Brie cheese, an hour
before your time, you would say the same. Aristide
sat at the foot of the bed and laughed till the tears
ran down his beard.</p>

<p>As soon as it was decent I sent him into the city
to interview Blessington. Three hours afterward
he returned more radiant than ever. He threw
himself into my arms; before I could disentagle
myself, he kissed me on both cheeks; then he danced
about the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Me voici</em>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;accredited representative of
the great Maison Dulau et Compagnie. I have
hundreds of pounds a year. I go about. I watch.
I control. I see that the Great British Public can
assuage its thirst with the pure juice of the grape
and not with the dregs of a laboratory. I test vintages.
I count barrels. I enter them in books. I
smile at Algerian wine growers and say, &lsquo;Ha! ha!
none of your <em>petite piquette fr&eacute;late&eacute;</em> for me but
good sound wine.&rsquo; It is diplomacy. It is as simple
as kissing hands. And I have a sustained income.
Now I can be <em>un bon bourgeois</em> instead of a stray
cat. And all due to you, <em>mon cher ami</em>. I am grateful&mdash;<em>voyons</em>&mdash;if
anybody ever says Aristide Pujol
is ungrateful, he is a liar. You believe me! Say
you believe me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, old chap,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>I had known Aristide for some years, and in all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
kinds of little ways he had continuously manifested
his gratitude for the trifling service I had rendered
him, at our first meeting, in delivering him out of
the hands of the horrific Madam Gougasse. That
gratitude is the expectation of favors to come was,
in the case of Aristide, a cynical and inapplicable
proposition. And here, as this (as far as I can
see) is the last of Aristide&#8217;s adventures I have to
relate, let me make an honest and considered statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>During the course of an interesting and fairly
prosperous life, I have made many delightful Bohemian,
devil-may-care acquaintances, but among
them all Aristide stands as the one bright star who
has never asked me to lend him money. I have
offered it times without number, but he has refused.
I believe there is no man living to whom Aristide
is in debt. In the depths of the man&#8217;s changeling
and feckless soul is a principle which has carried
him untarnished through many a wild adventure.
If he ever accepted money&mdash;money to the Proven&ccedil;al
peasant is the transcendental materialised, and Aristide
(save by the changeling theory) was Proven&ccedil;al
peasant bone and blood&mdash;it was always for what he
honestly thought was value received. If he met
a man who wanted to take a mule ride among the
Mountains of the Moon, Aristide would at once
have offered himself as guide. The man would
have paid him; but Aristide, by some quaint spiritual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
juggling, would have persuaded him that the
ascent of Primrose Hill was equal to any lunar
achievement, seeing that, himself, Aristide Pujol,
was keeper of the Sun, Moon and Seven Stars; and
the gift to that man of Aristide&#8217;s dynamic personality
would have been well worth anything that he
would have found in the extinct volcano we know
to be the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only thing I would suggest, if you would
allow me to do so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is not to try to make
the fortune of Messrs. Dulau &amp; Co. by some dazzling
but devastating <em>coup</em> of your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me in his bright, shrewd way. &ldquo;You
think it time I restrained my imagination?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will read The Times and buy a family Bible,&rdquo;
said Aristide.</p>

<p>A week after he had taken up his work in
the City, under my friend Blessington, I saw
the delighted and prosperous man again. It
was a Saturday and he came to lunch at my
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tiens!</em>&rdquo; said he, when he had recounted his success
in the office, &ldquo;it is four years since I was in
England?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, with a jerk of memory. &ldquo;Time
passes quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is three years since I lost little Jean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is little Jean?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
&ldquo;Did I not tell you when I saw you last in
Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is strange. I have been thinking about him
and my heart has been aching for him all the time.
You must hear. It is most important.&rdquo; He lit a
cigar and began.</p>

<p>It was then that he told me the story of which
I have already related in these
chronicles:<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
how he was scouring France in a ramshackle automobile
as the peripatetic vendor of a patent corn cure
and found a babe of nine months lying abandoned
in the middle of that silent road through the
wilderness between Salon and Arles; how instead
of delivering it over to the authorities, he adopted
it and carried it about with him from town to town,
a motor accessory sometimes embarrassing, but always
divinely precious; how an evil day came upon
him at Aix-en-Provence when, the wheezing automobile
having uttered its last gasp, he found his
occupation gone; how, no longer being able to care
for <em>le petit</em> Jean, he left him with a letter and half
his fortune outside the door of a couple of English
maiden ladies who, staying in the same hotel, had
manifested great interest in the baby and himself;
and how, in the dead of the night, he had tramped
away from Aix-en-Provence in the rain, his pockets
light and his heart as heavy as lead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
&ldquo;And I have never heard of my little Jean
again,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t you write?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew their names, Honeywood; Miss Janet
was the elder, Miss Anne the younger. But the
name of the place they lived at I have never been
able to remember. It was near London&mdash;they used
to come up by train to matin&eacute;es and afternoon concerts.
But what it is called, <em>mon Dieu</em>, I have racked
my brain for it. <em>Sacr&eacute; mille tonnerres!</em>&rdquo; He leaped
to his feet in his unexpected, startling way, and
pounced on a Bradshaw&#8217;s Railway Guide lying on
my library table. &ldquo;Imbecile, pig, triple ass that I
am! Why did I not think of this before? It is near
London. If I look through all the stations near
London on every line, I shall find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I lit a cigarette and took up a novel. I had not
read very far when a sudden uproar from the
table caused me to turn round. Aristide
danced and flourished the Bradshaw over his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chislehurst! Chislehurst! Ah, <em>mon ami</em>, now
I am happy. Now I have found my little Jean.
You will forgive me&mdash;but I must go now and embrace
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chislehurst, where else?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said I, rising, &ldquo;do you
seriously suppose that these two English maiden
ladies have taken on themselves the responsibility
of that foreign brat&#8217;s upbringing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu!</em>&rdquo; said he taken aback for the moment,
hypothesis having entered his head. Then, with
a wide gesture, he flung the preposterous idea to
the winds. &ldquo;Of course. They have hearts, these
English women. They have maternal instincts.
They have money.&rdquo; He looked at Bradshaw again,
then at his watch. &ldquo;I have just time to catch a
train. <em>Au revoir, mon vieux.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I objected, &ldquo;why don&#8217;t you write? It&#8217;s
the natural thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write? <em>Bah!</em> Did you ever hear of a Proven&ccedil;al
writing when he could talk?&rdquo; He tapped his
lips, and in an instant, like a whirlwind, he passed
from my ken.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Aristide on his arrival at Chislehurst looked
about the pleasant, leafy place&mdash;it was a bright
October afternoon and the wooded hillside blazed
in russet and gold&mdash;and decided it was the perfect
environment for Miss Janet and Miss Anne,
to say nothing of little Jean. A neat red brick
house with a trim garden in front of it looked
just the kind of a house wherein Miss Janet and
Miss Anne would live. He rang the bell. A parlour-maid,
in spotless black and white, tutelary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
nymph of Suburbia, the very parlour-maid who
would minister to Miss Janet and Miss Anne,
opened the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Honeywood?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not here, sir,&rdquo; said the parlour-maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she? I mean, where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one of that name lives here,&rdquo; said the parlour-maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who does live here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel Brabazon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where do the two Miss Honeywood live?&rdquo;
he asked with his engaging smile.</p>

<p>But English suburban parlour-maids are on their
guard against smiles, no matter how engaging. She
prepared to shut the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I find out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might enquire among the tradespeople.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, mademoiselle, you are a most intelligent
young&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door shut in his face. Aristide frowned. She
was a pretty parlour-maid, and Aristide didn&#8217;t like
to be so haughtily treated by a pretty woman. But
his quest being little Jean and not the eternal feminine,
he took the maid&#8217;s advice and made enquiries
at the prim and respectable shops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said a comely young woman in a fragrant
bakers&#8217; and confectioners&#8217;. &ldquo;They were two
ladies, weren&#8217;t they? They lived at Hope Cottage.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
We used to supply them. They left Chislehurst
two years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sacr&eacute; nom d&#8217;un chien!</em>&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon?&rdquo; asked the young woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am disappointed,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;Where
did they go to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember whether they had a baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were maiden ladies,&rdquo; said the young
woman rebukingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But anybody can keep a baby without being its
father or mother. I want to know what has become
of the baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young woman gazed through the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better ask the policeman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s an idea,&rdquo; said Aristide, and, leaving her,
he caught up the passing constable.</p>

<p>The constable knew nothing of maiden ladies
with a baby, but he directed him to Hope Cottage.
He found a pretty half-timber house lying back
from the road, with a neat semi-circular gravelled
path leading to a porch covered thick with Virginia
creeper. Even more than the red brick residence
of Colonel Brabazon did it look, with its air
of dainty comfort, the fitting abode of Miss Janet
and Miss Anne. He rang the bell and interviewed
another trim parlour-maid. More susceptible to
smiles than the former, she summoned her master,
a kindly, middle-aged man, who came out into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
porch. Yes, Honeywood was the name of the previous
tenants. Two ladies, he believed. He had
never seen them and knew nothing about a child.
Messrs. Tompkin &amp; Briggs, the estate agents in the
High Street, could no doubt give him information.
Aristide thanked him and made his way to Messrs.
Tompkin &amp; Briggs. A dreary spectacled youth in
resentful charge of the office&mdash;his principals, it being
Saturday afternoon, were golfing the happy
hours away&mdash;professed blank ignorance of everything.
Aristide fixed him with his glittering eye
and flickered his fingers and spoke richly. The
youth in a kind of mesmeric trance took down a
battered, dog&#8217;s eared book and turned over the
pages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honeywood&mdash;Miss&mdash;Beverly Stoke&mdash;near St.
Albans&mdash;Herts. That&#8217;s it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Aristide made a note of the address. &ldquo;Is that
all you can tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you very much, my young friend,&rdquo; said
Aristide, raising his hat, &ldquo;and here is something
to buy a smile with,&rdquo; and, leaving a sixpence on the
table to shimmer before the youth&#8217;s stupefied eyes,
Aristide strutted out of the office.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;You had much better have written,&rdquo; said I, when
he came back and told me of his experiences. &ldquo;The
post-office would have done all that for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
&ldquo;You have no idea of business, <em>mon cher ami</em>&rdquo;&mdash;(I&mdash;a
successful tea-broker of twenty-five years&#8217;
standing!&mdash;the impudence of the fellow!)&mdash;&ldquo;If I
had written to-day, the letter would have reached
Chislehurst on Monday morning. It would be redirected
and reach Hertfordshire on Tuesday. I
should not get any news till Wednesday. I go
down to Beverly Stoke to-morrow, and then I find
at once Miss Janet and Miss Anne and my little
Jean! The secret of business men, and I am a business
man, the accredited representative of Dulau
et Compagnie&mdash;never forget that&mdash;the secret of
business is no delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He darted across the room to Bradshaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&#8217;s sake,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;put that nightmare
of perpetual motion in your pocket and go mad over
it in the privacy of your own chamber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said he, tucking the brain-convulsing
volume under his arm. &ldquo;I will put it on top of
The Times and the family Bible and I will say
&lsquo;Ha! now I am British. Now I am very respectable!&rsquo;
What else can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rent a pew in a Baptist chapel,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After a three-mile trudge from St. Albans Aristide,
following directions, found himself on a high
road running through the middle of a straggy common
decked here and there with great elms splendid
in autumn bravery, and populated chiefly by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
geese, who when he halted in some perplexity&mdash;for
on each side, beyond the green, were indications
of a human settlement&mdash;advanced in waddling
flocks towards him and signified their disapproval
of his presence. A Sundayfied youth in a rainbow
tie rode past on a bicycle. Aristide took off his
hat. The youth nearly fell off the bicycle, but British
doggedness saved him from disaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beverly Stoke? Will you have the courtesy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; bawled the youth, with a circular twist
of his head, and, eager to escape from a madman,
he rode on furiously.</p>

<p>Aristide looked to left and right at the little
houses beyond the green&mdash;some white and thatched
and dilapidated, others horridly new and perky&mdash;but
all poor and insignificant. As his eyes became
accustomed to the scene they were aware of human
forms dotted sparsely about the common. He
struck across and accosted one, an elderly woman
with a prayer-book. &ldquo;Miss Honeywood? A lady
from London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That house over there&mdash;the third beyond the
poplar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And little Jean&mdash;a beautiful child about four
years old?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I don&#8217;t know, sir. I live at Wilmer&#8217;s End,
a good half mile from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide made for the third house past the poplar.
First there was a plank bridge across a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
grass-grown ditch; then a tiny patch of garden; then a
humble whitewashed cottage with a small leaded
casement window on each side of the front door.
Unlike Hope Cottage, it did not look at all the residence
of Miss Janet and Miss Anne. Its appearance,
indeed, was woe-begone. Aristide, however,
went up to the door; as there was neither knocker
nor bell, he rapped with his knuckles. The door
opened, and there, poorly dressed in blouse and
skirt, stood Miss Anne.</p>

<p>She regarded him for a moment in a bewildered
way, then, recognizing him, drew back into the
stone flagged passage with a sharp cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You? You&mdash;Mr. Pujol?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Oui, Mademoiselle, c&#8217;est moi.</em> It is I, Aristide
Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her hands on her bosom. &ldquo;It is rather
a shock seeing you&mdash;so unexpectedly. Will you
come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She led the way into a tiny parlour, very clean,
very simple with its furniture of old oak and brass,
and bade him sit. She looked a little older than
when he had seen her at Aix-en-Provence. A few
lines had marred the comely face and there was
here and there a touch of grey in the reddish hair,
and, though still buxom, she had grown thinner.
Care had set its stamp upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Honeywood,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;It is on account
of little Jean that I have come&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
She turned on him swiftly. &ldquo;Not to take him
away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he is here!&rdquo; He jumped to his feet and
wrung both her hands and kissed them to her great
embarrassment. &ldquo;Ah, mademoiselle, I knew it. I
felt it. When such an inspiration comes to a man,
it is the <em>bon Dieu</em> who sends it. He is here, actually
here, in this house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Anne.</p>

<p>Aristide threw out his arms. &ldquo;Let me see him.
<em>Ah, le cher petit!</em> I have been yearning after him
for three years. It was my heart that I ripped out
of my body that night and laid at your threshold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Miss Anne, with an interrupting
gesture. &ldquo;You must not talk so loud. He is asleep
in the next room. You mustn&#8217;t wake him. He is
very ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ill? Dangerously ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m afraid so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu</em>,&rdquo; said he, sitting down again in the
oak settle. To Aristide the emotion of the moment
was absorbing, overwhelming. His attitude betokened
deepest misery and dejection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I expected to see him full of joy and
health!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not my fault, Mr. Pujol,&rdquo; said Miss Anne.</p>

<p>He started. &ldquo;But no. How could it be? You
loved him when you first set eyes on him at Aix-en-Provence.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Miss Anne began to cry. &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;what I should do without him. The dear
mite is all that is left to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All? But there is your sister, the dear Miss
Janet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Anne&#8217;s eyes were hidden in her handkerchief.
&ldquo;My poor sister died last year, Mr. Pujol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry. I did not know,&rdquo; said Aristide
gently.</p>

<p>There was a short silence. &ldquo;It was a great sorrow
to you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was God&#8217;s will,&rdquo; said Anne. Then, after another
pause, during which she dried her eyes, she
strove to smile. &ldquo;Tell me about yourself. How
do you come to be here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide replied in a hesitating way. He was in
the presence of grief and sickness and trouble; the
Proven&ccedil;al braggadocio dropped from him and he
became the simple and childish creature that he was.
He accounted very truthfully, very convincingly,
for his queer life; for his abandonment of little
Jean, for his silence, for his sudden and unexpected
appearance. During the ingenuous <em>apologia pro
vita sua</em> Miss Anne regarded him with her honest
candour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Janet and I both understood,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Janet
was gifted with a divine comprehension and pity. The
landlady at the hotel, I remember, said some unkind
things about you; but we didn&#8217;t believe them. We
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
felt that you were a good man&mdash;no one but a good
man could have written that letter&mdash;we cried over
it&mdash;and when she tried to poison our minds we said
to each other: &lsquo;What does it matter? Here God in
his mercy has given us a child.&rsquo; But, Mr. Pujol,
why didn&#8217;t you take us into your confidence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Anne,&rdquo; said Aristide, &ldquo;we of the
South do things impulsively, by lightning flashes.
An idea comes suddenly. <em>Vlan!</em> we carry it out in
two seconds. We are not less human than the
Northerner, who reflects two months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is almost what dear, wise Janet told me,&rdquo;
said Miss Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you know in your heart,&rdquo; said Aristide,
after a while, &ldquo;that if I had not been only a football
at the feet of fortune, I should never have deserted
little Jean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, Mr. Pujol. My sister and I have been
footballs, too.&rdquo; She added with a change of tone:
&ldquo;You tell me you saw our dear home at Chislehurst?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you see this. There is a difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; asked Aristide.</p>

<p>She told him the commonplace pathetic story.
Their father had left them shares in the company
of which he had been managing director. For
many years they had enjoyed a comfortable income.
Then the company had become bankrupt and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
only a miserable ninety pounds a year had been
saved from the wreckage. The cottage at Beverly
Stoke belonging to them&mdash;it had been their mother&#8217;s&mdash;they
had migrated thither with their fallen fortunes
and little Jean. And then Janet had died.
She was delicate and unaccustomed to privation
and discomfort&mdash;and the cottage had its disadvantages.
She, Anne herself, was as strong as a horse
and had never been ill in her life, but others were
not quite so hardy. &ldquo;However&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled&mdash;&ldquo;one
has to make the best of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Parbleu</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>Miss Anne went on to talk of Jean, a miraculous
infant of infinite graces and accomplishments. Up
to now he had been the sturdiest and merriest
fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At nine months old he saw that life was a big
joke,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;How he used to laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s not much laugh left in him, poor darling,&rdquo;
she sighed. And she told how he had caught
a chill which had gone to his lungs and how the
night before last she thought she had lost him.</p>

<p>She sat up and listened. &ldquo;Will you excuse me
for a moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went out and presently returned, standing
at the doorway. &ldquo;He is still asleep. Would you
like to see him? Only&rdquo;&mdash;she put her fingers on her
lips&mdash;&ldquo;you must be very, very quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He followed her into the next room and looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
about him shyly, recognizing that it was Miss
Anne&#8217;s own bedroom; and there, lying in a little
cot beside the big bed, he saw the sleeping child,
his brown face flushed with fever. He had a curly
shock of black hair and well formed features. An
old woolly lamb nose to nose with him shared his
pillow. Aristide drew from his pocket a Teddy
bear, and, having asked Miss Anne&#8217;s permission
with a glance, laid it down gently on the
coverlid.</p>

<p>His eyes were wet when they returned to the
parlour. So were Miss Anne&#8217;s. The Teddy bear
was proof of the simplicity of his faith in her.</p>

<p>After a while, conscious of hunger, he rose to
take leave. He must be getting back to St. Albans.
But might he be permitted to come back later in
the afternoon? Miss Anne reddened. It outraged
her sense of hospitality to send a guest away from
her house on a three-mile walk for food. And
yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pujol,&rdquo; she said bravely, &ldquo;I would ask you
to stay to luncheon if I had anything to offer you.
But I am single handed, and, with Jean&#8217;s illness,
I haven&#8217;t given much thought to housekeeping. The
woman who does some of the rough work won&#8217;t
be back till six. I hate to let you go all those miles&mdash;I
am so distressed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;You have
some bread. You have water. It has been a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
banquet many a day to me, and this time it would be
the most precious banquet of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do a little better than that,&rdquo; faltered Miss
Anne. &ldquo;I have plenty of eggs and there is bacon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eggs&mdash;bacon!&rdquo; cried Aristide, his bright eyes
twinkling and his hands going up in the familiar
gesture. &ldquo;That is superb. <em>Tiens!</em> you shall not do
the cooking. You shall rest. I will make you an
<em>omelette au lard</em>&mdash;<em>ah!</em>&rdquo;&mdash;he kissed the tips of his
fingers&mdash;&ldquo;such an omelette as you have not eaten
since you were in France&mdash;and even there I doubt
whether you have ever eaten an omelette like mine.&rdquo;
His soul simmering with omelette, he darted towards
the door. &ldquo;The kitchen&mdash;it is this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Pujol&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; Miss Anne laughed, protestingly.
Who could be angry with the vivid and
impulsive creature?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the room opposite Jean&#8217;s&mdash;not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She followed him into the clean little kitchen,
half amused, half flustered. Already he had hooked
off the top of the kitchen range. &ldquo;Ah! a good fire.
And your frying-pan?&rdquo; He dived into the scullery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&#8217;t be in such a hurry,&rdquo; she pleaded.
&ldquo;You will have made the omelette before I&#8217;ve had
time to lay the cloth, and it will get cold. Besides,
I want to learn how to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Tr&eacute;s bien</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide, laying down the frying-pan.
&ldquo;You shall see how it is made&mdash;the omelette
of the universe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
So he helped Miss Anne to lay the cloth on the
gate-legged oak table in the parlour and to set it
out with bread and butter and the end of a tinned
tongue and a couple of bottles of stout. After
which they went back to the little kitchen, where
in a kind of giggling awe she watched him shred
the bacon and break the eggs with his thin, skilful
fingers and perform his magic with the frying-pan
and turn out the great golden creation into the
dish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, pulling her in his enthusiasm,
&ldquo;to table while it is hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Anne laughed. She lost her head ever so
little. The days had been drab and hopeless of
late and she was still young; so, if she felt excited
at this unhoped for inrush of life and colour, who
shall blame her? The light sparkled once more in
her eyes and the pink of her naturally florid complexion
shone on her cheek as they sat down to
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I who help it,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;Taste
that.&rdquo; He passed the plate and waited, with the
artist&#8217;s expectation for her approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was indeed the perfection of omelette, all its
suave juiciness contained in film as fine as goldbeater&#8217;s
skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&#8217;s good.&rdquo; He was delighted, childlike, at
the success of his cookery. His gaiety kept the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
careworn woman in rare laughter during the meal.
She lost all consciousness that he was a strange
man plunged down suddenly in the midst of her
old maidish existence&mdash;and a strange man, too, who
had once behaved in a most outrageous fashion.
But that was ever the way of Aristide. The moment
you yielded to his attraction he made you feel
that you had known him for years. His fascination
possessed you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Anne,&rdquo; said he, smoking a cigarette, at
her urgent invitation, &ldquo;is there a poor woman in
Beverly Stoke with whom I could lodge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gasped. &ldquo;You lodge in Beverly Stoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why yes,&rdquo; said Aristide, as if it were the most
natural thing in the world. &ldquo;I am engaged in the
city from ten to five every day. I can&#8217;t come here
and go back to London every night, and I can&#8217;t
stay a whole week without my little Jean. And I
have my duty to Jean. I stand to him in the relation
of a father. I must help you to nurse him
and make him better. I must give him soup and
apples and ice cream and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would kill the darling in five minutes,&rdquo; interrupted
Miss Anne.</p>

<p>He waved his forefinger in the air. &ldquo;No, no, I
have nursed the sick in my time. My dear friend,&rdquo;
said he, with a change of tone, &ldquo;when did you go to
bed last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; she answered in some confusion.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
&ldquo;The district nurse has helped me&mdash;and the doctor
has been very good. Jean has turned the corner
now. Please don&#8217;t worry. And as for your coming
to live down here, it&#8217;s absurd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you formally forbid me to do so,
mademoiselle, and if you don&#8217;t want to see me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you say a thing like that? Haven&#8217;t I
shown you to-day that you are welcome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Anne,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;forgive me. But
what is that great vast town of London to me who
know nobody there? Here in this tiny spot is concentrated
all I care for in the world. Why
shouldn&#8217;t I live in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would be so dreadfully uncomfortable,&rdquo;
said Miss Anne, weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried Aristide. &ldquo;You talk of discomfort
to an old client of <em>L&#8217;H&ocirc;tel de la Belle &Eacute;toile</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hotel of the Beautiful Star? Where is
that?&rdquo; asked the innocent lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherever you like,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;Your bed
is dry leaves and your bed-curtains, if you demand
luxury, are a hedge, and your ceiling, if you are
fortunate, is ornamented with stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him wide-eyed, in great concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you have ever been homeless?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed. &ldquo;I think I&#8217;ve been everything imaginable,
except married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Her keen ear had
caught a child&#8217;s cry. &ldquo;It&#8217;s Jean. I must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
She hurried out. Aristide prepared to light another
cigarette. But a second before the application
of the flaring match an idea struck him. He
blew out the match, replaced the cigarette in his
case, and with a dexterity that revealed the professional
of years ago, began to clear the table. He
took the things noiselessly into the kitchen, shut the
door, and master of the kitchen and scullery washed
up. Then, the most care-free creature in the world,
he stole down the stone passage into the wilderness
of Beverly Stoke.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards he knocked at the front door,
Anne Honeywood admitted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have arranged with the good Mrs. Buttershaw.
She lives a hundred yards down the road.
I bring my baggage to-morrow evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne regarded him in a humorous, helpless way.
&ldquo;I can&#8217;t prevent you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I can give you
a piece of advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t wash up for Mrs. Buttershaw.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>So it came to pass that Aristide Pujol took up
his residence at Beverly Stoke, trudging every
morning three miles to catch his business train at
St. Albans, and trudging back every evening three
miles to Beverly Stoke. Every morning he ran
into the cottage for a sight of little Jean and every
evening after a digestion-racking meal prepared by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
Mrs. Buttershaw he went to the cottage armed with
toys and weird and injudicious food for little Jean
and demanded an account of the precious infant&#8217;s
doings during the day. Gradually Jean recovered
of his congestion, being a sturdy urchin, and, to
Aristide&#8217;s delight, resumed the normal life of childhood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Moi, je suis papa</em>,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;He has got
to speak French, and he had better begin at once.
It is absurd that anyone born between Salon and
Arles should not speak French and Proven&ccedil;al; we&#8217;ll
leave Proven&ccedil;al till later. <em>Moi, je suis papa, Jean.</em>
Say <em>papa</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t quite see how he can call you that, Mr.
Pujol,&rdquo; said Anne, with the suspicion of a flush on
her cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not? Has the poor child any other
papa in the whole wide world? And at four years
old not to have a father is heart-breaking. Do you
want us to bring him up an orphan? No. You
shan&#8217;t be an orphan, <em>mon brave</em>,&rdquo; he continued,
bending over the child and putting his little hands
against his bearded face, &ldquo;you couldn&#8217;t bear such a
calamity, could you? And so you will call me
<em>papa</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Papa</em>,&rdquo; said Jean, with a grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, he has settled it,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;<em>Moi
je suis papa.</em> And you, mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Auntie Anne,&rdquo; she replied demurely.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Saturday afternoons and Sundays were Aristide&#8217;s
days of delight. He could devote himself entirely
to Jean. The thrill of the weeks when he had
paraded the child in the market places of France
while he sold his corn cure again ran through his
veins. The two rows of cottages separated by the
common, which was the whole of Beverly Stoke,
became too small a theatre for his parental pride.
He bewailed the loss of his automobile that had
perished of senile decay at Aix-en-Provence. If he
only had it now he could exhibit Jean to the astonished
eyes of St. Albans, Watford&mdash;nay London
itself!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could take him to Dulau &amp; Company,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; cried Miss Anne in alarm, for
Aristide was capable of everything. &ldquo;What in the
world would you do with him there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would I do with him?&rdquo; replied Aristide,
picking the child up in his arms&mdash;the three were
strolling on the common&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Parbleu!</em> I would use
him to strike the staff of Dulau &amp; Company green
with envy. Do you think the united efforts of the
whole lot of them, from the good Mr. Blessington
to the office boy, could produce a hero like this?
You are a hero, Jean, aren&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; said Jean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He knows it,&rdquo; shouted Aristide with a delighted
gesture which nearly cast Jean to the circumambient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
geese. &ldquo;Miss Anne, we have the most wonderful
child in the universe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, as far as Anne was concerned, was a
proposition which for the past three years
she had regarded as incontrovertible. She
smiled at Aristide, who smiled at her, and
Jean, seeing them happy, smiled largely at them
both.</p>

<p>In a very short time Aristide, who could magically
manufacture boats and cocks and pigs and
giraffes out of bits of paper, who could bark like
a dog and quack like a goose, who could turn himself
into a horse or a bear at a minute&#8217;s notice,
whose pockets were a perennial mine of infantile
ecstasy, established himself in Jean&#8217;s mind as a kind
of tame, necessary and beloved jinn. Being a loyal
little soul, the child retained his affection for Auntie
Anne, but he was swept off his little feet by his
mirific parent. The time came when, if he was
not dressed in his tiny woollen jersey and knee
breeches and had not his nose glued against the
parlour window in readiness to scramble to the
front door for Aristide&#8217;s morning kiss, he would
have thought that chaos had come again. And
Anne, humouring the child, hastened to get him
washed and dressed in time; until at last, so greatly
was she affected by his obsession, she got into the
foolish habit of watching the clock and saying to
herself: &ldquo;In another minute he will be here,&rdquo; or:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
&ldquo;He is a minute late. What can have happened
to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Aristide, in his childlike way, found remarkable
happiness in Beverly Stoke. A very wet summer
had been followed by a dry and mellow autumn.
Aristide waxed enthusiastic over the English climate
and rejoiced in the mild country air. He was
also happy under my friend Blessington, who spoke
of him to me in glowing terms. At the back of all
Aristide&#8217;s eccentricities was the Proven&ccedil;al peasant&#8217;s
shrewdness. He realized that, for the first time in
his life, he had taken up a sound and serious avocation.
Also, he was no longer irresponsible. He
had found little Jean. Jean&#8217;s future was in his
hands. Jean was to be an architect&mdash;God knows
why&mdash;but Aristide settled it, definitely, off-hand.
He would have to be educated. &ldquo;And, my dear
friend,&rdquo; said he, when we were discussing Jean&mdash;and
for months I heard nothing but Jean, Jean,
Jean, so that I loathed the brat, until I met the
brown-skinned, black-eyed, merry little wretch and
fell, like everybody else, fatuously in love with him&mdash;&ldquo;my
dear friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an architect, to be
the architect that I mean him to be, must have universal
knowledge. He must know the first word
of the classic, the last word of the modern. He
must be steeped in poetry, his brain must vibrate
with science. He must be what you call in England
a gentleman. He must go to one of your great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
public schools&mdash;Eton, Winchester, Rugby, Harrow&mdash;you
see I know them all&mdash;he must go to Cambridge
or Oxford. Ah, I tell you, he is to be a big
man. I, Aristide Pujol, did not pick him up on
that deserted road, in the Arabia Petrea of Provence,
between Salon and Arles, for nothing. He was
wrapped, as I have told you, in an old blanket&mdash;and
<em>ma foi</em> it smelt bad&mdash;and I dressed him in my
pyjamas and made a Neapolitan cap for him out of
one of my socks. The <em>bon Dieu</em> sent him, and I
shall arrange just as the <em>bon Dieu</em> intended. Poor
Miss Anne Honeywood with her ninety pounds a
year, what can she do? Pouf! It is for me to look
after the future of little Jean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By means of such discourse he convinced Miss
Anne that Jean was predestined to greatness and
that Providence had appointed him, Aristide, as
the child&#8217;s agent in advance. Very much bewildered
by his riotous flow of language and
very reluctant to sacrifice her woman&#8217;s pride, she
agreed to allow him to contribute towards Jean&#8217;s
upbringing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Anne,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is my right. It is
Jean&#8217;s right. You would love to put him on top
of the pinnacle of fame, would you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Miss Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Eh bien!</em> we will work together. You will give
him what can be given by a beautiful and exquisite
woman, and I will do all that can be done by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
accredited agent of Dulau et Compagnie, Wine
Shippers of Bordeaux.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, I repeat, Aristide was entirely happy. His
waking dreams were of the four-year-old child.
The glad anticipation of the working day in Great
Tower St., E. C., was the evening welcome from
the simple but capable gentlewoman and the sense
of home and intimacy in her little parlour no bigger
than the never-entered and nerve-destroying salon
of his parents at Aigues Mortes, but smiling with
the grace of old oak and faded chintz. At Aigues
Mortes the salon was a comfortless, tasteless convention,
set apart for the celebrations of baptisms
and marriages and deaths, a pride and a terror to
the inhabitants. But here everything seemed to be
as much a warm bit of Anne Honeywood as the
tortoise-shell comb in her hair and the square of
Brussels lace that rose and fell on the bosom of
her old evening frock. For, you see, since she expected
a visitor in the evenings, Anne had taken
to dressing for her sketch of a dinner. For all
her struggle with poverty she had retained the
charm that four years before had made her
touch upon Jean seem a consecration to the
impressionable man. And now that he entered
more deeply into her life and thoughts, he found
himself in fragrant places that were very strange
to him. He discovered, too, with some surprise,
that a man who has been at fierce grips with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Fortune all his life from ten to forty is ever so little
tired in spirit and is glad to rest. In the tranquility
of Anne Honeywood&#8217;s presence his soul was
singularly at peace. He also wondered why Anne
Honeywood seemed to grow younger, and, in her
gentle fashion, more laughter-loving, every day.</p>

<p>The Saint Martin&#8217;s summer lasted to the beginning
of December, and then it came to an end, and
with it the idyll of Aristide and Anne Honeywood.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon, when the rain was falling
dismally, she received him with an embarrassment
she could scarcely conceal. The usual heightened
colour no longer gave youth to her cheek; an
anxious frown knitted her candid brows; and there
was no laughter in her eyes. He looked at her
questioningly. Was anything the matter with Jean?
But Jean answered the question for himself by running
down the passage and springing like a puppy
into Aristide&#8217;s arms. Anne turned her face away,
as if the sight pained her, and, pleading a headache
and the desire to lie down, she left the two together.
Returning after a couple of hours with the tea-tray,
she found them on the floor breathlessly absorbed
in the erection of card pagodas. She bit her lip
and swallowed a sob. Aristide jumped up and took
the tray. Was not the headache better? He was
so grieved. Jean must be very quiet and drink up
his milk quietly like a hero because Auntie was
suffering. Tea was a very subdued affair. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Anne carried off Jean to bed, refusing Aristide&#8217;s
helpful ministrations. It was his Saturday and
Sunday joy to bath Jean amid a score of crawly
tin insects which he had provided for the child&#8217;s
ablutionary entertainment, and it formed the climax
of Jean&#8217;s blissful day. But this afternoon Anne
tore the twain asunder. Aristide looked mournfully
over the rain-swept common through the leaded
panes, and speculated on the enigma of woman. A
man, feeling ill, would have been only too glad for
somebody to do his work; but a woman, just because
she was ill, declined assistance. Surely
women were an intellect-baffling sex.</p>

<p>She came back, having put Jean to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; she said, with a blurt of bravery,
&ldquo;I have something very hard to say, but I must
say it. You must go away from Beverly Stoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Aristide, &ldquo;is it I, then, that give you
a headache?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s not your fault,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;You have
been everything that a loyal gentleman could be&mdash;and
it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re a loyal gentleman that you
must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t understand,&rdquo; said he, puzzled. &ldquo;I must
go away because I give you a headache, although
it is not my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s nothing to do with headaches,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you see? People around here are
talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
&ldquo;About you and me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Anne, faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Saprelotte!</em>&rdquo; cried Aristide, with a fine flourish,
&ldquo;let them talk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against Jean and myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reproach brought him to his feet. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;No. Sooner than they should talk, I
would go out and strangle every one of them. But
it is infamous. What do they say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I tell you? What would they say in
your own country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;France is France and England is England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a little cackling village is the same all the
world over. No, my dear friend&mdash;for you are my
dear friend&mdash;you must go back to London, for the
sake of my good name and Jean&#8217;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But let us leave the cackling village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are geese on every common,&rdquo; said Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Nom de Dieu!</em>&rdquo; muttered Aristide, walking about
the tiny parlour. &ldquo;<em>Nom de Dieu de nom de Dieu!</em>&rdquo;
He stood in front of her and flung out his arms
wide. &ldquo;But without Jean and you life will have
no meaning for me. I shall die. I shall fade away.
I shall perish. Tell me, dear Miss Anne, what they
are saying, the miserable peasants with souls of
mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Anne could tell him no more. It had been
hateful and degrading to tell him so much. She
shivered through all her purity. After a barren
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
discussion she held out her hand, large and generous
like herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated for the fraction of a
second&mdash;&ldquo;Good-bye, Aristide. I promise you shall
provide for Jean&#8217;s future. I will bring him up to
London now and then to see you. We will find
some way out of the difficulty. But you see, don&#8217;t
you, that you must leave Beverly Stoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aristide went back to his comfortless lodgings
aflame with bewilderment, indignation and despair.
He fell upon Mrs. Buttershaw, a slatternly and sour-visaged
woman, and hurled at her a tornado of questions.
She responded with the glee of a hag, and
Aristide learned the amazing fact that in the matter
of sheer uncharitableness, unkindness and foulness
of thought Beverly Stoke, with its population
of three hundred hinds, could have brought down
upon it the righteous indignation of Sodom, Gomorrah,
Babylon, Paris, and London. For a fortnight
or so Anne Honeywood&#8217;s life in the village
had been that of a pariah dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you&#8217;ve spoke of it yourself,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Buttershaw, her hands on her hips, &ldquo;I&#8217;m glad.
I&#8217;m a respectable woman, I am, and go to church
regularly, and I don&#8217;t want to be mixed up in such
goings on. And I never have held with foreigners,
anyway. And the sooner you find other lodgings,
the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first and only time in his life words
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
failed Aristide Pujol. He stood in front of the virtuous
harridan, his lips working, his fingers convulsively
clutching the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;you naughty woman!&rdquo; he
gasped, and, sweeping her away from the doorway
of his box of a sitting-room, he rushed up to his
tinier bedroom and in furious haste packed his portmanteau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather die than sleep another night beneath
your slanderous roof,&rdquo; he cried at the foot
of the stairs. &ldquo;Here is more than your week&#8217;s
money.&rdquo; He flung a couple of gold coins on the
floor and dashed out into the darkness and the rain.</p>

<p>He hammered at Anne Honeywood&#8217;s door. She
opened it in some alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said he, dumping his portmanteau
in the passage, &ldquo;to take you and Jean away from
this abomination of a place. It is a Tophet reserved
for those who are not good enough for hell. In
hell there is dignity, <em>que diable!</em> Here there is none.
I know what you have suffered. I know how they
insult you. I know what they say. You cannot stay
one more night here. Pack up all your things.
Pack up all Jean&#8217;s things. I have my valise here.
I walk to St. Albans and I come back for you in an
automobile. You lock up the door. I tell the policeman
to guard the cottage. You come with me. We
take a train to London. You and Jean will stay at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
a hotel. I will go to my good friend who saved
me from Madam Gougasse. After that we will
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s just like you,&rdquo; she said, smiling in spite
of her trouble, &ldquo;you act first and think afterwards.
Unfortunately I&#8217;m in the habit of doing the reverse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&#8217;s I who am doing all the thinking for
you. I have thought till my brain is red hot.&rdquo; He
laughed in his luminous and excited way, and, seizing
both her hands, kissed them one after the other.
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;be ready by the time I return.
Do not hesitate. Do not look back. Remember
Lot&#8217;s wife!&rdquo; He flourished his hat and was gone
like a flash into the heavy rain and darkness of the
December evening. Anne cried after him, but he
too remembering Lot&#8217;s wife would not turn. He
marched on buoyantly, heedless of the wet and
the squirting mud from unseen puddles. It was
an adventure such as he loved. It was a knightly
errand, <em>parbleu!</em> Was he not delivering a beautiful
lady from the dragon of calumny? And in
an automobile, too! His imagination fondled the
idea.</p>

<p>At a garage in St. Albans he readily found a car
for hire. He was all for driving it himself&mdash;that is
how he had pictured the rescue&mdash;but the proprietor,
dull and unimaginative tradesman, declined firmly.
It was a hireling who drove the car to Beverly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Stoke. Anne, unhatted and uncloaked, admitted
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friend, how can I&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not coming?&rdquo; His hands dropped to
his sides and his face was the incarnation of disappointment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us talk things over reasonably,&rdquo; she urged,
opening the parlour door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have brought the automobile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can wait for five minutes, can&#8217;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can wait till Doomsday,&rdquo; said Aristide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take off your dripping coat. You must be wet
through. Oh, how impulsive you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took off his overcoat dejectedly and followed
her into the parlour, where she tried to point
out the impossibility of his scheme. How could
she abandon her home at a moment&#8217;s notice? Failing
to convince him, she said at last in some embarrassment,
but with gentle dignity: &ldquo;Suppose we
did run away together in your romantic fashion,
would it not confirm the scandal in the eyes of this
wretched village?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Aristide. &ldquo;I had not
thought of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew himself to be a madman. It was not
thus that ladies were rescued from calumny. But
to leave her alone to face it for time indefinite was
unthinkable. And, meanwhile, what would become
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
of him severed from her and little Jean? He sighed
and looked around the little room where he had
been so happy, and at the sweet-faced woman whose
companionship had been so dear to him. And then
the true meaning of all the precious things that had
been his life for the past two months appeared before
him like a smiling valley hitherto hidden and
now revealed by dissolving mist. A great gladness
gathered round his heart. He leaned across the
table by which he was sitting and looked at her and
for the first time noticed that her eyes were red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been crying, dear Anne,&rdquo; said he,
using her name boldly. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man ought not to put a question like that at
a woman&#8217;s head and bid her stand and deliver. How
is she to answer? Anne felt Aristide&#8217;s bright eyes
upon her and the colour mounted and mounted and
deepened on her cheeks and brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t like changes,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Aristide slipped noiselessly to the side of her chair
and knelt on one knee and took her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anne&mdash;my beloved Anne!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>And Anne neither moved nor protested, but looked
away from him into the fire.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And that is all that Aristide told me. There are
sacred and beautiful things in life that one man does
not tell to another. He did, however, mention that
they forgot all about the unfortunate chauffeur
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
sitting in the rain till about three hours afterwards,
when Aristide sped away to a St. Albans hotel in
joyous solitude.</p>

<p>The very next day he burst in upon me in a state
of bliss bordering on mania.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is a tragic side to it,&rdquo; he said when the
story was over. &ldquo;For half the year I shall be exiled
to Bordeaux, Marseilles and Algiers as the representative
of Dulau et Compagnie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very best thing that could happen for your
domestic happiness,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? With my heart&rdquo;&mdash;he thumped his heart&mdash;&ldquo;with
my heart hurting like the devil all the
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So long as your heart hurts,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you know
it isn&#8217;t dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A short while afterwards they were married in
London. I was best man and Jean, specklessly attired,
was page of honour, and the vicar of her own
church at Chislehurst performed the ceremony. The
most myopic of creatures could have seen that Anne
was foolishly in love with her rascal husband. How
could she help it?</p>

<p>As soon as the newly wedded pair had received
the exhortation, Aristide, darting to the altar-rail,
caught Jean up in his arms, and, to the consternation
of the officiating clergy, the verger, and Anne&#8217;s
conventional friends, cried out exultingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ah, mon petit.</em> It was a lucky day for both of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
us when I picked you up on the road between Salon
and Arles. Put your hands together as you do when
you&#8217;re saying your prayers, <em>mon brave</em>, and say,
&lsquo;God bless father and mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean obediently adopted the attitude of the infant
Samuel in the pictures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless father and mother,&rdquo; said he, and the
childish treble rang out queerly in the large, almost
empty church.</p>

<p>There was a span of silence and then all the
women-folk fell on little Jean and that was the end
of that wedding.</p>

<h2>THE GLORY OF CLEMENTINA</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY</strong></p>

<h2>William J. Locke</h2>

<p class="center">Author of &ldquo;The Belov&egrave;d Vagabond,&rdquo; &ldquo;Simon the
Jester,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p class="center">
<em>Cloth</em>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>12mo</em></span>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>$1.30 net</em></span>   <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>Postage 12 cents</em></span></p>

<p class="center">Illustrations by Arthur I. Keller</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Locke has succeeded in uniting with the firm carefulness
of his early work the rapid, fluent, vibrating style that
makes his later books so delightful; therefore it is easy to make
the deduction that &lsquo;Clementina&rsquo; is the best piece of work he has
done.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>New York Evening Sun</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Among the novels of the past five years no books have more
consistently produced an effect at once certain, satisfactory and
delightful than those of William J. Locke. This latest addition
to his shelf is full of life and laughter and the love not only of
man for woman but of man for man and for humanity. Mr.
Locke is a born story-teller and a master of the art of expression.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>The Outlook</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;The book contains a mass of good material, with original
characterization, and is written in a style piquant and clever.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>The Literary Digest</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;A story containing the essence of humanity, with an abundance of
sensible and sensitive, casual and unobtrusive commentary
upon life and man, and especially upon woman.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Boston Evening Transcript</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;It contains even more of the popular qualities than are usually
associated with the writings of this noted author.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Boston Times</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Locke&#8217;s flights into the realms of fancy have been a
delight to many readers. He has a lightness of touch that is
entirely captivating, and his remarkable characterization of inconsequent
people gives them a reality that is very insistent.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Baltimore Evening Sun</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never has he drawn so deeply from that well that is the
human heart; never so near those invisible heights which are
the soul; and, if we are not altogether mistaken, &lsquo;The Glory of
Clementina&rsquo; will also prove to be that of its author.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Baltimore News</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;A fascinating story with delicate, whimsical touches.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Albany Times-Union</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;The book seems destined to live longer than any written
by the author to date, because it is so sane and so fundamentally true.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Philadelphia Enquirer</em></p>

<h2>MANALIVE</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY</strong></p>

<h2>Gilbert K. Chesterton</h2>

<p class="center">Author of &ldquo;The Innocence of Father Brown,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Heretics,&rdquo; &ldquo;Orthodoxy,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p class="center">
<em>Cloth</em>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>12mo</em></span>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>$1.30 net</em></span>   <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><em>Postage 12 cents</em></span>
</p>

<p class="center">Frontispiece and Jacket Illustration by Will Foster</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chesterton has undertaken in this quaint narrative to
make burlesque the vehicle of a sermon and a philosophy. It
is all a part of the author&#8217;s war upon artificial attitudes which
enclose the living men like a shell and make for human purposes
a dead man of him. He speaks here in a parable&mdash;a parable of
his own kind, having about it a broad waggishness like that of
Mr. Punch and a distinct flavor of that sort of low comedy which
one finds in Dickens and Shakespeare. You are likely to find,
before you are done with the parable, that there has been forced
upon your attention a possible view of the life worth living.
&lsquo;Manalive&rsquo; is a &lsquo;Peterpantheistic&rsquo; novel full of Chestertonisms.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>New
York Times</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the oddest books Mr. Chesterton has yet given us.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>New
York Evening Globe</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;The fun of the book (and there is plenty of it) comes quite
as much from the extraordinary and improbable characters as
from the situations. Epigrams, witticisms, odd fancies, queer
conceits, singular whimsies, follow after one another in quick
succession.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Brooklyn Eagle</em></p>


<p>&ldquo;One of the most humorous tales of modern fiction, combined
with a very tender and appealing love story.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Cleveland
Plain Dealer</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;The book is certain to have a wide circulation, not only
because of the name of the author attached to it, but because
of its own intrinsic worth.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Buffalo Commercial</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;There can be no doubt as to the iridescent brilliance of the
book. Page after page&mdash;full of caustic satire, humorous sally and
profound epigram&mdash;fairly bristles with merriment. The book is
a compact mass of scintillating wit.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Philadelphia Public Ledger</em></p>
